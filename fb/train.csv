  more i can t make any real suggestions on improvement i wondered if the section statistics should be later on  or a subsection of types of accidents  i think the references may need tidying so that they are all in the exact same format ie date format etc  i can do that later on  if no one else does first if you have any preferences for formatting style on references or want to do it yourself please let me know there appears to be a backlog on articles for review so i guess there may be a delay until a reviewer turns up  it s listed in the relevant form eg wikipedia good article nominations  trans port ,0

sorry if the word  nonsense  was offensive to you  anyway  i m not intending to write anything in the article wow they would jump on me for vandalism i m merely requesting that it be more encyclopedic so one can use it for school as a reference  i have been to the selective breeding page but it s almost a stub  it points to  animal breeding  which is a short messy article that gives you no info  there must be someone around with expertise in eugenics ,0

  fair use rationale for image wonju jpg  thanks for uploading image wonju jpg  i notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in wikipedia articles constitutes fair use  in addition to the boilerplate fair use template  you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale if you have uploaded other fair use media  consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too  you can find a list of  image  pages you have edited by clicking on the my contributions link  it is located at the very top of any wikipedia page when you are logged in and then selecting image from the dropdown box  note that any fair use images uploaded after may and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded  as described on criteria for speedy deletion  if you have any questions please ask them at the media copyright questions page  thank you talk contribs unspecified source for image wonju jpg  thanks for uploading image wonju jpg  i noticed that the file s description page currently doesn t specify who created the content  so the copyright status is unclear  if you did not create this file yourself  then you will need to specify the owner of the copyright  if you obtained it from a website  then a link to the website from which it was taken  together with a restatement of that website s terms of use of its content  is usually sufficient information  however  if the copyright holder is different from the website s publisher  then their copyright should also be acknowledged as well as adding the source  please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn t have one already  if you created took the picture  audio  or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the gfdl  if you believe the media meets the criteria at wikipedia fair use  use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at wikipedia image copyright tags fair use  see wikipedia image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use if you have uploaded other files  consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them  too  you can find a list of files you have uploaded by following this link unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged  as described on criteria for speedy deletion  if the image is copyrighted under a non free license  per wikipedia fair use  then the image will be deleted hours after if you have any questions please ask them at the media copyright questions page  thank you talk contribs ,0

before you start throwing accusations and warnings at me  lets review the edit itself making ad hominem attacks isn t going to strengthen your argument  it will merely make it look like you are abusing your power as an admin now  the edit itself is relevant this is probably the single most talked about event int he news as of late  his absence is notable  since he is the only living ex president who did not attend  that s certainly more notable than his dedicating an aircracft carrier i intend to revert this edit  in hopes of attracting the attention of an admin that is willing to look at the issue itself  and not throw accusations around quite so liberally  perhaps  if you achieve a level of civility where you can do this  we can have a rational discussion on the topic and resolve the matter peacefully ,0

 re considering  st paragraph edit  i don t understand the reasons for  s recent edit of this article  not that i m sure that the data are necessarily wrong  rather  i m persuaded that the strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is an unhelpful approach to this specific subject i note that articles about other sitting justices have been similarly enhanced and i also believe those changes are no improvement  in support of my view that this edit should be reverted  i would invite anyone to re visit articles written about the following pairs of jurists a benjamin cardozo  a learned hand b john marshall harlan  b john marshall harlan ii  the question becomes  would the current version of the wikipedia article about any one of them  or either pair  be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph i think not perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument kathleen sullivan of stanford law makes when she suggests that some on the harvard law faculty wonder how antonin scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging i would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point  less humorous  but an even stronger argument is the one clarence thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to yale at a minimum  i m questioning this edit it deserves to be reconsidered  ,0

 not at all  you are making a straw man argument here  i never claimed o donohue had that position  rather that practitioners and researchers in the field ignored the dsm position  which is exactly what the quote says and also something o donohue agrees with  again  i was combating the notion that it was a absurd part to claim that pedophilia is a  sex  orientation  since many researchers hold this position  it would be unfair to call it absurd  the disorder part is divided in the field  some argue that it is not a disorder at all  some do  at the end of the day  it is a value judgment  as cantor pointed out earlier in the thread not a scientific judgement  if we choose to make this value judgment in the article  it should be stated clearly and not pretend to have a scientific basis  ,0
 mainland asia includes the lower basin of china s yangtze river as well as korea but being specific is fine too i just found a citation for a more comprehensive dna study by hammer below  rather than our generarizations and speculation so far  citation for yayoi culture was brought to japan by migrants from korea  who in turn trace their roots to southeast asia south china dna study by hammer  describes the yayoi migration from korea based on the o sry genes and other genes with close lineage  haplogroups o m and o m reiterates that the entire o haplogroup has been proposed to have a southeast asian origin  their definition of southeast asia includes southern china then hypothesizes that the dispersals of neolithic farmers from southeast asia also brought haplogroup o lineages to korea and eventually to japan  in the concluding paragraph  it states we propose that the yayoi y chromosomes descend from prehistoric farmers that had their origins in southeastern asia  perhaps going back to the origin of agriculture in this region  hammer s dna study is based on a global sample consisted of males from asian populations  including six populations sampled from across the japanese archipelago  ,0

i don t believe the lisak criticism present there conforms with the npv rule lisak doesn t have a neutral point of view to begin with if an offer to polygraph or even concerned review of polygraph results shocks a complainant into thinking her lies have been uncovered  the recantation is still perfectly valid if you know you are telling the truth  you will argue with machine or investigator also part of kanin s research was a followup of the recanted story where possible to verify if any were false recantations in all followups the recanted version of events matched what the accused said happened arguing that lisak is a respected phd is baseless if kanin is a respected phd i agree that my edit wasn t as neutral as possible though  so apologize for that still something must be done here ,0

 jmabel  in regards to predominant scholary consensus who is it that allegedly claims despite third way rhetoric  fascism in power functioned rather consistently as a right wing force as far as i m aware  owning numerous books on the subject  that is not the scholary consensus at all  the consensus  developed by respected scholars of fascism who write in a manner which is not bias to any interest group such as roger griffin  hamish mcdonald  roger eatwell and zeev sternhell all recongise fascism as a third way as the references show the only dissenters i m aware of who seem to think fascism has absoutely no leftist connections and is merely a radical right system are street level socialists who want to put as much distance between the movements as possible  this of course does not come from educated people in a position to write books  for example  even the foremost scholary expert on fascism  and a former member of both the communist party and then socialist party of italy  renzo de felice doesn t try to cover up its socialistic origins and third way status  this is a man who has wrote a definitive seven volume piece on mussolini ,0
 bi  you said you wanted to talk  at the bottom of the lead section you have written its promoter speculated in that the skyhook concept could be cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator  but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts  in addition  the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials regarding in addition  the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials that statement appears to come from ref on page the full quote is if the mass of the tether alone started to exceed times the mass of the payload  then that was an indication the particular scenario being considered was not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials  although the application might become feasible in the near future as better materials become available with higher tensile strengths at higher operational temperatures  it then goes on to say as we shall see  presently available commercial materials will suffice to make the hastol tethers needed  the primary message we want to leave with the reader is we don t need magic materials like buckminster fuller carbon nanotubes to make the space tether facility for a hastol system  existing materials will do  so it would appear that you misread your reference the tether mass of times mass of the payload mass is the upper limit to the problem systems where the tether mass is less than times the payload mass can be built with presently available commercial materials  to further reinforce this the conclusion to the report states the fundamental conclusion of the phase i hastol study effort is that the concept is technically feasible  we have evaluated a number of alternate system configurations that will allow hypersonic air breathing vehicle technologies to be combined with orbiting  spinning space tether technologies to provide a method of moving payloads from the surface of the earth into earth orbit  for more than one hastol architecture concept  we have developed a design solution using existing  or near term technologies  we expect that a number of the other hastol architecture concepts will prove similarly technically feasible when subjected to detailed design studies  the systems are completely reusable and have the potential of drastically reducing the cost of earth to orbit space access  regarding but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts  and a boeing report on the possibillity of combining skyhooks with hypersonic planes concluded that in general  the non spinning tether hyperskyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts the full quote is hyperskyhook  in zubrin proposed the hypersonic skyhook as a solution to the mismatch between the attainable atmospheric speeds of a hypersonic airplane and the orbital speeds of space tethers  since the orbital speed of the space tether decreases with increasing altitu,0

 is it scientific to attribute an event a  to cause b  where cause b was deliberate designed  with some sort of intelligent intent  don t answer the questions beyond that well  the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged  there are several major fundamental problems here  first  you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind id is quite literally not of this earth  natural science might look at a honeycomb  see it is built by bees  and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb  and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees  that is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth  id has at its core the notion that something outside the system we can observe is at cause here  this is not science in any sense of the word  it is mythology  when paul bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox  they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes  no evidence of paul and his ox remain  i mean  really  second  natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable  theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up  id turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with probabilities if no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally  how in the hell can id proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate probability of flagella naturally forming on bacteria  if you don t understand it  you can t do statistics on it  id jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn t have a complete  detailed  natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say well  it s so improbable for this to happen  that someone must have designed it this is such a perversion of science  you can assign probabilities to something you don t understand  id is just making up their numbers  finally  your example has a  b  where b was deliberate design  that s all well and good for a rigged example  except that with respect to life on earth  b is unknown  your a  b example might qualify as forensic science  if a were a dead body and b were a bullet in the heart  you see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart  the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart  you can probably figure that s what killed him  you don t have that with life on earth  you have one scenario  a and you have no other cases to observe or test  so  in that sense  a  b is not scientific if you ve never actually observed b btw  b is teh intelligent designer  which has never been observed so  in that sense  no  it isn t science  ,0

lack of balance  this article is seriously out of balance it would benefit greatly from the introduction of additional information about the negative aspects of the t just for the record  this sort of balance problem is not uncommon when there is an over dependence on the works of a particular author for example  testing and evaluation of a t by the us army ordnance dept  exposed some very serious problems with the tank this type of information should be included in the article to bring it back into balance ,0

i tend to think that when the list is longer than the rest of the article  there s a problem either the history and characteristics should be expanded  of the list should be culled i personally like the consensus that was reached in the tripel article between  and others myself included we decided that the country of origin should be highlighted with the most examples there we did trappist  abbey  and foreign foreign includes all non belgium examples this way the article is an article in an encyclopedia  not a list people can find lists anywhere  and the article should reference this also  the style statistics are bad when you say style statistics  it sounds like a prescription  not a description an encyclopedia should follow the latter  and if the former is used  a citation should follow and you ll not find a valid one for this style in it s country of origin ,0

 czech republic is in central europe  the state of this article is part of the reason why people are making such confusions  especially more ridiculous is that they you would replace the mention of north caucasus in favor of north slope of caucasus mountains which isnt even a geographical area other than denoting the mountains in that region  countries are located within continents  yet for some reason you refuse to allow this article to be denoted a continent  this single factor alone would have made a massive difference for readers  i m tired of arguing with people who are essentially wiki squatters refusing to nudge on a given article ,0

paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized however  the term fossilized is not a very precise term there are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil one major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate  invertebrates  radiolarians  sponges  plants  pollen  foot prints  etc and multiple processes may include permineralization  recrystalization  carbonization  replacement  dissolving  diagenesis  etc talking about fossilization is a complex issue  however quick burial is not questioned the major question is  how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab  which of course implies that given the right conditions  vast ages are not an issue the metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood  but rather that there has been some years for the processes to have been working much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains yet  how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with ,0

ahh  hello witzeman symbols m m characters greek cyrillic ipa  t d my famous article witze  happiness wikipedia the witzeman is a great honour that has been passed down through the generations of many families  regardless of race  age  character or knowledge  the outside world knows little about these elusive characters  and the honour of the witzeman  for those who have ever been a witzeman  it has been said to have been a great honour  although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed  a person may not now they were a witzeman for many years  until they are called by former witzemans via dreams  associates of the witzeman are known to be a certain babe cool or the much lesser known witzewoman the present witzeman is an year old boy namely benjamin woods  who is said to have become a witzeman after he felt this  awesome radiance in his top right bumcheek he has not told a great number of people his testimony  but has promised to do so in years to come  history the present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the witzeman in present years  because former witzemen have not been so public about the honour  to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time  the term  witzeman  is a compound word of the adjective witze and  man witze being an th century term for  a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence unfortuneatly  witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind  for unspeakable reasons  proper history as early as the th century  witzemen were considered outcasts  and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks  this led to the  st witzeman rebellion of when the current witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local council chess team  this rebellion further disgraced the witzeman  as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced  gaga  at a government meeting that year  the period from here to the early s was a dark time in the witzemans history  however good times were to come for the witzeman  many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the witzeman in the s  building up to a great moment in the history the great rebellion of this was when several witzeman sprinted round the visitors gallery of the house of commons  wearing clown masks  but otherwise completely naked  this was thought to be an act of circambulation  however many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour  were  mentally  spiritually  and emotionaly scarred for life this group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability  suffering from trauma  it was at this time that the government finally took positive action for the witzeman  in a bill of rights for the witzeman was signed  stating all witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased  although this was a formal agreement  many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the government to the witzeman  as the behaviour of the witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted ,0

 socialistm there are two important features of smith s concept of the invisible hand first  smith was not advocating a social policy  that people should act in their own self interest but rather was describing an observed economic reality  that people do act in their own interest second  smith was not claiming that all self interest has beneficial effects on the community  he did not argue that self interest is always good  he merely argued against the view that self interest is necessarily bad  it is worth noting that  upon his death  smith left much of his personal wealth to charity good let s all make sure we put forth the idea that adam smith was a socialist that s the wikipedia way  ,0

 attributing and classifying of personalities invitation  your input to culture of lithuania is welcomed some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well known ideological systems may raise here  i propose a quite liberal variant of it  where definition may not be connected with one certain word  necessity however to follow certain classifying remains  my initial ideas on this branch  the ones  concerning period of lithuanian national renaissance period  some artists  writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists  this definition is not false  but some more concrete things should be added  some specifics of lithuania we should distinguish leading ideas of the nat  renaissance from later modernism  which is more known for us  cultural aspirations of the later nat  ren  may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of lithuania  but they accented also expression of lithuanian cultural heritage  and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  lithuanian  i mean  that such authors in as iurlionis is seen as modernist in lithuanian context  but it also  and even more  is a representative of lithuanian culture  when in european or world wide context  a parallel  example may be taken from literature of india  poet  tagore  well known nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of india  making india more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to western culture  but in his own country  he was seen as a modernist too  who was changing traditional cultural forms  especially stagnated ones  this way also lithuanian cultural leaders of the n  ren  could be seen as modernists  which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones  in lithuanian context  they also can be seen as modernists in a wider context  but more for acquainting western people with lithuanian culture than for their direct input into western culture  iurlionis is the best example here in other way  the later lithuanian modernists  they depended mostly to later  generation  approximately from  th decade of the th century  concerned themselves part of western modernistic movement and their main purpose  looking generally  was  to introduce western european ideas into lithuanian cultural life  see the table below we see two different movements and two different world outlooks here  the problem is  that both movements collaborated  especially their political wings did  and interchange of ideas between them is well seen  so  many researchers don t pay attention to this difference  especially in the soviet period  when national ideas were officially forbidden  mixture in description of these movements was allowed  e  g  philosopher ram  nas bytautas  who clearly depends to the first generation  is often described as liberal  and it may be understood in a sense of the second generation  as idea of liberalism period and generation  artists  writers  philosophers etc in a context of lithuania in an european context the national renaissance period  the younger generation  approx painter and composer iurlionis  painter kazys imonis  poet and philosopher vilius storastas vyd  nas  dramatist sofija kymantait iurlionien poets adomas jak  tas  motiejus gustaitis  liudas gira  composer stasys imkus  philosopher ram  nas bytautas reformers and innovators of lithuanian culture representatives of lithuanian culture  almost unknown before them  the period between wwi and wwii and post war years  poets v mykolaitis putinas  kazys binkis  writer ignas einius jurk  nas  artists  all  ars  group philosopher juozas girnius  modernists  introducing new western ideas into lithuanian cultural life  central european modernism note  lists of personalities isn t complete here  nor it s made precisely by prominence jul utc ,0

homo sex s are intent on legitimizing their behavior  therefore  they will seize any opportunity to suggest that famous persons are  gay in this way  their way of life will be received as being not only harmless  but perfectly normal  as generations of people grow from childhood to maturity and are exposed to this strategy  they increasingly develop a tolerance for homo sex ity  in this way  it is now almost universally accepted as a diverse or alternate behavior or way of being  similar to a religion  race or nationality  lestrade,0

 a totallydisputed notice would probably be appropriate  given the depth of disagreement that exists here  but i cannot understand why highlighting statements identified by some as dubious would constitute disfiguring the article slimvirgin has also used that wording recently  but i rather think that inaccurate and irrelevant information is more of a disfigurement than is a template notice to answer your second question  my side has brought forward a proposal  and the other side has not yet responded this is sadly consistent with recent patterns of delay  i ll make no comment on whether or not this is a deliberate strategy  ,0

 randroide answers to next step guys  i do not see you taking steps to wikipedia requests for mediation i can not do this job because i always connect from filtered institutional net access  and following those steps could result in new  undesired  controversial truncation of words by the software  i do not want that happenning could you please follow the instructions in the link i provided thank you  randroide answers to new reference by burgas at last we agree on something  of course that the new section is a good idea  the false suicidal terrorists from prisa will also be included there  come on  boys  start writing that section  i do not want all the kudos for myself  the new proposed article is  by now  an effort made only by me  but remember  npov and sources  all the sources  just like me citing el pa  s in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the th bomb  cheers indeed  a good point  and all the remarks in cope too  and the moral certitudes of mariano rajoy published in el mundo  i agree with you larean  what randroide omits to mention on the section about the th bomb is that he only added balancing references when i insisted that he do so  the original version he created was entirely pov  as is much of the rest of the proposed article  also  all the sources that he added from el pais are only available to subscribers npov it is not  you are right  southofwatford  in your randroide omits  section if you have not subscription to el pa  s i am sorry but that  s your problem  my institutional access also has some advantages  like paid access to el pa  s and many  many other publications and books that  s one of the reasons for my exclusive use of filtered internet acces  it  s much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources do you see the truncation of words is offsett  i think  by better sources btw  if you write under a randroide answers section you are  invading my space  i do not mind  really  but you are doing it  risking new truncations on your messages  to avoid this  please write outside randroide answers sections if you think that the proposed article is pov  work in it to make it npov  the article is not mine i ll take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here  it s very short  the issue is not whether i subscribe to el pa  s  its whether the people who read an article in the english wikipedia subscribe to it  all sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article  putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is npov is  to my mind  completely unreasonable  all sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article  very funny  southofwatford  i am going to follow this joke of yours please propose also the deletion of all books as sources  because  did you know there is always someone without this or that book  delete all references to tv or radio stations  because that user in brazil has no tv and no radio at home  delete all the references in spanish  because  did you know there are users who know no spanish it  s a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes  really  i had a good laugh user southofwatford  how strange that you should find it so funny  after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced  so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny  it s simply bizarre  equally  in the english wikipedia i would argue that choosing a spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in english does not make sense  except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing your cynicism is evident in your response ,0

  the organization of sub topics  culture is thrown way down towards the end  after economy and tourism  which is inappropriate  the information section is unnecessarily loaded with history and detailed geography  which makes it not only uninteresting  but also repetitive  information is interspersed all through the sub sections  without regard to whether or not they fit there  eg  the geography section starts with the fact that up is the  th largest state  that is not strictly geography  and belongs in the introduction  climate belongs towards the latter part of the page  perhaps before toursim  regions and cities is not such an interesting combination  in any case  cities of uttar pradesh can be an interesting topic on its own  because  up has several interesting cities  and regions  each with specialities of its own  like the copperware of moradabad  ceramics of khurja and carpets of bhadohi in fact i remember there used to be such information in the article before  ,0
i don t know the answer to this  but  legally  how is it possible for a private citizen to violate another private citizen s civil rights  i don t know if this is the section nelson was charged under in the federal case  but if anyone could explain this  i would appreciate it you can argue whether or not the outcome of the state murder trial was justified  that s really not my concern here  since it s a dead letter i m concerned about whether the subsequent civil rights prosecution was legal if the state murder acquittal was a miscarriage of justice  it s not the first time look at issei sagawa part of having a mature understanding of this sort of thing is to realize that the criminal justice system isn t perfect  and that it is inevitable that innocent people will be convicted  and that guilty people will be acquited  from time to time that s the price you pay for having a legal system  in the end someone has to make the decision  and sometimes they may not necessarily get it right i don t think it s going out on a limb to say that the sagawa case is completely beyond all reasonable belief ,0

 deletion of account ok blueboy  editing from l g ng l has been disabled by blueboy for the following reason s came back from hour block and picked it right back up again and judging by history  not likely to get it for this this is to call attention to a topic which was resolved before any of the matters were addressed there are moderators deleting wikipedia history items  and moderator borgqueen s edit of cuisine of hawaii was simply a provocation and nothing more i am a reknowned chef of pacific rim cuisine  and the cuisine of hawaii  and the cuisine of hawaii is not local plate lunch that is like saying the cuisine of mexico is frozen burritos  or that the cuisine of canada is starbucks pastries  or that the cuisine of america is mcdonald s  its slanderous  vicious  and spiteful the main point here is why did the admin in question delete the history and no  it is not resolved until that problem is addressed and i tried discussing it with that user directly and my account was locked  that user is not open for discussion or ddebate  that admin suffers the god complex  and lovcked me from even editing my own page  hence the reason i had to wait to be unbanned to post here  and i am not leving here to back and become corrupt admin fodder back aon the topic page until thius matter is resolved between borgqueen and myself as i i will not subjegate myself to any further discrimination  hazing  or personal vendettas not likely to get it eh buddy listen up  you will delete my user page and account from the wiki  grommet  you are not going to lock me and keep my name  content or profile i am out of this facade which is wikipedia for good delete it all  now  grommet ,0

 s rant  presently  we are witnessing  an open war against croatian dinaric culture croatian left often portrays this culture as primitive and rural even fashist being  in  service of conservative hdz party  croatian writer predrag raos  for instance  performed on gusle instrument in zagreb on several occasions this year with only one intention to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition  another apostle of croatian left miljenko jergovi refers to his political opponents on the right as gusle players some even claim the serbian origin of croatian dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater serbian propagabda  all tokavian people and their culture are serbian however  croatian dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly croatian  dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture  for example  the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music  marko kraljevi is associated with dalmatian island hvar through petar hektorovi s book ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje also  the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  dubrovnik even now  a contemporary croatian writer  born in dubrovnik  stijepo mijovi ko  an tells us a story about his uncle  also from dubrovnik area  who could memorize numerous gusle songs  stijepo mijovi ko  an  gusle  glasnik  may p dubrovnik is also a home of anica begin  born kalafatovi a daughter of famous gusle player ante  although illiterate  she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs  some of which were recorded in antology of croatian folk poetry  not far from dubrovnik  another coastal city makarska was  also a bastion of croatian gusle music  actually  this region could be considered the capital of all croatian gusle players  this mediterranean area  also gave birth to  andrija ka  i mio  i th century catholic priest who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of croatia and beyond  to honour ka  i s work  ivan me  trovi the most famous croatian sculptor  built a sculpture in america showing ka  i in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument  in addition to ka  i makarska littoral produced a great many other followers of croatian gusle music  according to dr  fra karlo juri  i who quotes the work of croatian folklorist stipan banovi zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with stipan kosovi kudri and culminating with the most known mate banovi trli as for dalmatian women  they didn t play gusle  it s considered a male activity only yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound  olinko delorko  the researcher of  dalmatian  folk poetry in the s  states in his book ljuba ivanova that most of his dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women  especially the ones from the island of hvar  the zadar littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition  english writer maude m  holbach  travelling through zadar region in the first decade of th century  states in her book dalmatia  the land where east meets west that the gusle was the national instrument of the region  as for dinaric dances  which took place at markets and certain festivals  they  are very picturesque and interesting  and worth going a long way to see  being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in europe  p this admiration for dinaric folk music  particularly gusle  was seen in both dalmatian litteral and  hinterland matija murko  the researcher of this literary music forms had reported that during his trips  through dalmatia in the s  he saw a child  barely three years old playing gusle  eduard osrede  ki hrvatske narodne juna  ke pjesme eljezno be p now  lets  take a look at  the names of some dalmatian sports clubs and organizations  hajduk  junak  gusar  alkar  uskok  sinjska alka  etc  what do they have in common  of course  their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region  having this in mind  one wonders why this proud croatian heritage has become almost  extinct why do we have so few gusle players today is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock  n  roll  culture if so  why has tamburitza music of northern croatia  gained wide acceptance from the croatian establishment while its  dinaric counterpart  gusle music  is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre,0

  the vote was on the campbell case but the primary reason was the russian treaties baldwin was careful to emphasise that the treaties were the substance of his objections  standfordham wrote to the king  on october i saw mr baldwin who  in reply to my question do you want to turn the government out said yes  but not on the campbell issue  but on the russian treaties which the country generally condemns  he sees no alternative to a dissolution  it has always been expected  some wished for it before now  though he is opposed to hastening the government s fall and it is true that only in the house of commons were baldwin s strictures based on the campbell case at newcastle on october he congratulated macdonald on the agreement  achieved at a conference in london  on the dawes plan for reparations  and then spent the rest of the speech alternately pouring scorn on the labour party s subservience to its extremists  and tearing to pieces the russian agreement  but the final debate on october was a mean parliamentary occasion  two days before  in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet  the cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence  preferring to go out on the campbell case to a defeat on the russian treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence  middlemas and barnes  p ,0

the discussion of when there first were outdoor trees with electric lights is very strange are you kidding  and some obscure town in nc  i don t think this makes much sense  especially since the sentences immediately preceding these establish that other cities had electrically lighted  outdoor christmas trees in the early years of the th century  the article cited for the north carolina town  if read carefully  really only states that the tradition of having outdoor lighted trees in that specific town began in not that the town claims it was the first place to have such trees  i am old enough to have been around in though i was a small boy  and i can tell you that we and our neighbors in southern california had lighted  outdoor trees prior to and no one thought it remarkable or unusual  the history here is questionable  to say the least ,0

 thanks  from my point of view there are differences and parallels between the two concepts  one parallel is that both concepts are intending a territory with a homogeneous population  the difference is  the concept of racial hygiene is intending a homogeneous population regarding the criterium race w hate ver race might be the concept of ethnically homogeneous states is intending a homogeneous population regarding the criterium ethnicity a second difference is that the concept of racial hygiene has led to more extreme forms and methods in political practice in history  example  the holocaust not only expulsion but also extinction of millions of people in an industrially organised process user  nov th ,0
well  i see futperf is getting quite angry now  insulting other editors also  and again their goal is make the point that the first bulgarian empire and the second bulgarian empire are not bulgarian or at least not related  which helps their long term strategy for the invention of a macedonian nation and state  think bulgarian tsar samuel  etc  which existed from antiquity and the middle ages  that s it  tropcho  correctly pointed out that direct political continuity is completely unimportant for the info box  no other country cares for this in their info box  neither spain  germany  ireland  poland  etc  what is important is to show how bulgaria formed thru the ages ,0

 quoting hoppe first  detailing kinsella s important points at this diff i put in the democracy section hoppe s earlier comment first and followed with more about what kinsella said  i e stephan kinsella writes that hoppe s critics have accused hoppe of homophobia  bigotry  and the like based on these passages  kinsella wrote that that hoppe s discussion of physically removing homo sex s and other groups only applied to private  covenant based communities centered around traditional values  he shared a letter hope wrote to him saying the  gay  couple down the street who mind their own business would not be expelled  but only those who are openly hostile to the basic hetero sex  or private property basis of society  as i said in my edit summary  just because some choose to totally take his comments about of context and attack him  does not mean that wikipedia should be used for the same purpose talkie talkie ,0

  unfortunately  judging from previous warnings  some people here have a rather unusual view of what personal attacks are  pointing out that the individuals accusing me of using sockpuppets were incorrect  and in fact the two main people making the accusations have been harassing me for months and had used sockpuppets and meat puppets themselves for getting around edit conflicts and to stack votes on a request for admin proceding  as pointed out by several editors at the time  certainly cannot be considered a personal attack  pointing out that admins did not have any actual policy basis to make the blocks is not a personal attack  and it has  in fact  been confirmed by the overruling of the blocks more than once frankly  if you are looking for personal attacks  try yourself for your agf violating attacks on my actions based upon limited information and actually misleading information given to you by other individuals  or david gerard for claiming that i am trolling when all i am doing is defending myself from false accusations of others  it s very clear that a number of people here need to realize that the very things they are accusing me of and trying to justify for a block are exactly what they themselves are doing from behind the pretense of trying to solve things if you want to start blocking for incivility  i might suggest removing david gerard for a while for his actions  or elonka for falsely claiming that i was using sockpuppets or that i was harassing her  or the sysop whose very talk page says he s going to go around blocking people no questions asked and in fact did so after i caught him restoring placing illegal information on how to pirate software an article talk page  rules should apply to everyone  and a number of people have been getting away with pretty flagrant violations and trying to rationalize them away by just labeling me as an alleged problem editor and not taking any sort of responsibility for their own actions  ,0

has anyone ever considered including tag team edit warring as a  rr violation  when two people act in tandem  unintentionally or intentionally  to make the same revert four times  they may not technically violate the  rr rule  but they certainly do so in spirit this was the problem on both sides in the edit war on the canada page  and precisely what i wanted to avoid on the dominion page  would it not be easier to warn editors as you did here rather than shut down pages for weeks at a time as was done in the canada case  i m sure this would cure the escalation problem without blocking access to pages  any comments on this ,0

in history there could be a consensus view or a mainstream view  in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view  since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian  historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity  while theology makes no such claims  it is true that there are millions who believe that jedp was birthed in hell  or would believe it if they knew what jedp means so in principle their view is notable  but as enns said  it is a fringe view in the academe  even among scholars who actually disagree with jedp  the sources used to build wikipedia are academic sources  therefore jedp and its st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia  while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to wp undue  this does not mean that wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong  wikipedia has no theology of its own but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view  of course  this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties  since as ehrman said in one of his bestsellers  us mainline protestant and catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes  so  in a sense  scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions  only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism  they are free to do this  but this cuts against their claims of being mainstream historians ,0

 again  i don t think this is productive  but i ll make my position clear anyway  oppose  there are some sources here that support the idea that various types of nuclear power have been considered as sustainable  but that wasn t the only reason the ips edits were reverted  this is one reason tying this into the above discussion is a bad idea  because this isn t just about the academic consensus on a loosely defined type of nuclear fission using the article to explain in context that nuclear power is in some ways sustainable  according to some points of view  would be fine  the edits introduced large quantities relatively weakly sourced material to present nuclear as being a primary and uncontroversial source of sustainable energy  the above sources support mentioning nuclear as one aspect of sustainability  they do not warrant altering the article to make nuclear energy the first specific section  nor do they warrant excessive ref bombing to support that perspective  while using similarly selective tactics to undermine those who hold a more critical perspective  this isn t just about verifiability  this is also about wp weight  even the sources presented here indicate that nuclear s sustainability is under researched and hinges on too many unknowns to be accepted without further comment  this is true for many areas of sustainable energy research  but especially nuclear  it is an active area of research  or areas  rather  which has a relatively small but extremely vocal core of active supporters  this should not be used to diminish that perspective or the potentially revolutionary research  but major context was being selectively left out from the proposed edits  ,0

 our friend decided to persist in using anon ips to disrupt the wellington talk page  basically he tried to hound me for an edit he thinks i should have discussed first  probably because it was british related and he s inherently racist reported fresh ip to spi his main account has a lovely hour ban  and some of those ips got a week ban also  that ll learn him  these isps should stop using dynamic ips  it only invites troublemakers and allows them to abuse their network all too easily  talk ,0
so  please back there and calmly ready to know the details of the discussion  before jumping to an conclusion  if you don t have the time or willingness to do so  please pass the case to someone who can  yes it takes more then one editor to edit war  the  talk page info  i believe is not being replied to because its an incoherent  wall of text as is the info being added to the article  would be best to post the changes on the talk page and ask for a copy edit of the info for proper english  i see your frustrated and it may be best to ask others to get involved  see wikipedia requests for comment its easy and fast  sorry  but redirect to these templates definitively didn t help please  be practical in your resolutions  and not simply leave in the charge of the user  for him her  turn around on confused templates  real walls of text  if you know what i mean  if they are easy for anyone already using them  i don t know  but they definitely are not fast  so  could you be more specific ,0

i have reverted your redirects  a redirect is effectively a deletion as it removes the article from view  given they have already survived afd before and an editor has opposed your redirects  the next stage is either open a discussion on the talkpages or taking it back to afd and making an argument for it being redirected  do not edit war to redirect articles against opposition ,0
what you claim contradicts with what nasrallah claim and hersh claim  thinking that israel destroyed half of lebanon in reaction to zar it shtula incident is just not logical  i see the claim that israel pre planned the war and it was not a reaction to zar it shtula incident logical and it makes sense ,0

 september utc the note s he left was a demand for intervention for his her side  s he was not asking for neutral mediation  that much is clear  and you shouldn t make little of that it only further arouses my suspicions that your intervention wouldn t be a neutral one  as for your question  i read your infobox and the categories on your profile about israel and got mixed up  thinking you re israeli  about my asking the wikiproject palestine people to not intervene  well  no one has intervened from that corner thus far they probably know the wikipedia rules better than i do  though  yes  i think it s absolutely necessary that people from other political persuasions provide balance in the conversation if precision s own canvassing is allowed to succeed ,0
topic ban violation and sock puppetry hello  you had some interaction with ip  in connection with the golan heights  so accordingly  i am notifying you and stifle of a matter that is of serious concern  i have reason to believe that this ip user is nableezy trying to circumvent a topic ban imposed on him by stifle  the ban forbids him from editing or commenting on the golan heights and all areas of israel and its environs including cities  settlements and regions  the ip in question geolocates to chicago  and the edit in question is consistent with nableezy s pov prior to the instant edits  the ip never made any edits to the topic area and the first edit that he makes in the topic area is to the golan heights  nableezy is also from chicago as evidenced from his early trait page but there is more  the subject ip also made edits to a hockey article involving players in the nhl  nableezy has expressed more than a passing interest for this subject as evidenced by this but the similarities between the ip user and nableezy do not end there  the subject ip made this edit on a very technical subject involving circuitry and electronics  nableezy attended illinois institute of technology  a school that emphasizes engineering and it evidenced by his early trait list so now we have an ip who  like nableezy  comes from chicago with interests in the golan heights  hockey and it  the coincidences are too great to ignore per wp duck  the evidence suggests that the ip is nableezy s sock puppet used to circumvent stifle s topic ban ,0

  yeah  i did notice the slight tension between the sentences  but the demarcation problem is not typically something taught alongside the scientific method  while identifying pseudoscience is maybe we could split the difference and say educators consider identifying pseudoscience  part of scientific literacy though there is an argument being presented here  i don t think it s one limited to paul hurd  even if he might be most well know for promoting it it seems like the solution  rather than taking a just assert it or just attribute it approach  either of which have logic behind them  that we find out who else shares this view and how broadly it is consideredeither by finding a source which addresses the scope or just more sources which echo the argument  ,0

 to be honest  i think that this is a fair comment  accordingly and as this is a much debated article i would like to propose this revised opening paragraph  the terms old style  or o s and new style  or n s are used in english language historical studies to indicate that the dating system used in the source material is one or other of the  historic  methods for determining the day on which the year starts  in the old style dating  the year began on march  whereas in the new style it began on january death warrant of charles i web page of the uk national archives a demonstration of new style meaning julian calendar with a start of year adjustment  additionally  more so in other parts of the world the terms are used to indicate the change from the historic calendar  for example  the julian calendar in europe and the americas  to the  modern  gregorian calendar the october  november  revolution britannica encyclopaedia  a demonstration of new style meaning the gregorian calendar stockton  j r  date miscellany i  the old and new styles the terms  old style  and  new style  are now commonly used for both the  start of year  and  leap year gregorian calendar changes  england wales  both in scotland i believe that  properly and historically  the  styles  really refer only to the  start of year  change  from march th to january and that the  leap year change should be described as the change from julian to gregorian spathaky  mike old style new style dates and the change to the gregorian calendar  increasingly parish registers  in addition to a new year heading after th march showing  for example had another heading at the end of the following december indicating this showed where the new style started even though the old style continued until th march we as historians have no excuse for creating ambiguity and must keep to the notation described above in one of its forms  it is no good writing simply th january for a reader is left wondering whether we have used the old or the new style reckoning  the date should either be written th january o s if indeed it was old style  or as th january the hyphen is best avoided as it can be interpreted as indicating a period of time  references are unchanged from current version comments ,0

 vfd on jew s by country this has not yet been submitted  and john would wig out if i submitted it myself  but i suggest you discuss this with others asap  i submit for your discussion with others that the author has little regard for misrepresenting the reliability of his figures  that the article gives a inferior knowledge than the jew ish population article does both of current and pass population tends  that the title is questionable in its honesty because as he shows at the top of the discussion page  following his prevuious pattern he should have used the less offensive title judaism by country  and finally  the figures which he has published do not come from the listed reference pages as he infers but have been generated by himself by multiplying the est populations by the rough percentage numbers for the countries as an example  being australian i checked his figure for australian jew s in his words  none of his references give his figure of nor do any of the reputable sources pretend to give percise religious numbers to six or eight digit accuracy  in fact  checking the references you quickly discover that the australian census gave the figure of people who marked judaism as their religion  that all other real estimates are based upon adjustments to that figure  as is discussed on this page i found by a christian research association  i finally did a google searchon his claimed figure to discover that wikipedia is the only publication claiming such a figure  so i finally submit that this article relects badly upon wikipedia and adds no meaningful value beyond the fine work already done in jew ish population  i am afraid this is seems to be another example of where this author has misrepresented certain details to create the illusion that he is scholarly npov author feb utc  ,0

 but wikipedia is wisdom of the crowd  see this aricle for kendall whitehouse  senior director of information technology at wharton  the most interesting question is whether the wisdom of the crowd is ultimately a better approach compared to scholarly review and edited content  as whitehouse observes  wikipedi ass trength is that it has thousands of eyes looking at it  the hope is that errors will be quickly caught and corrected marketing professor peter fader notes that wikipedia shows there is wisdom in crowds  but a better user rating system would filter out those who post bogus information  joel waldfogel  professor of business and public policy  agrees that much of the concern about wikipedia is just a new spin on whether old media  printed encyclopedias  in this case  stand a chance against the new breed of instantly updatable online media quoted from article in short  no matter what system you come up with here  it is going to be wisdom of the crowd  by design  that is what wiki is  so you might as well design a system around that concept  go with the natural design of the system  work with it to all its advantages  not work against it and try to limit it with old media concepts  ,0

vulcanization is not synonymous with curing after making the changing discussed immediately above  i reviewed the article further and find that this confusion is more deeply imbedded in this article the entire first paragraph equates vulcanization with any type of curing of sulfur which is not the case curing of rubber with some process has indeed been around for long before the europeans discoved rubber  but the term vulcanization was coined specifically to refer to the curing process that involved the addition of sulfur at high temperatures ,0

  um  the georg blume quote obviously implies that he was inquiring about the reason for the riots  james miles was there to report on the riots  so he would ask questions pertaining to the riots  if they actually wanted to separate  i can tell you right now that  logically  they would ve told them they wanted to and would say something to the effect of free us  we want to separate but they did not  they just explained their issues  which were socioeconomic and ethnic issues  in addition  james miles states the rioting seemed primarily an eruption of ethnic hatred which i m guessing he had to interview many rioters residents to ask them about it  and rather  i don t think the rodney king article is worded very well  it should be changed  but i m guessing many people are already well informed of the real reasons for those riots  unlike this riot where few seem to understand  including you  and  come on now  you re obviously just picking at straws to try to twist the article  all evidence so far points to the rioters looting and beating ethnic han chinese out of hatred  not because they want to separate or they would ve attacked much more government buildings rathern than focussing on the stores of more wealthy chinese people  right now  the article is pretty neutral as it already explains both sides and i hope people keep it this way ,0

this is a follow up criticism of gwen gale s improper deletion of the alex jones criticism section  i have tried to have this discussed in a responsible way on her talk page but she has outrageously deleted all the critiques i have posted there  in my view  gwen gale s actions and judgement are seriously called into question by her conduct apparent in this thread and subsequent attempts to discuss it  i will post the text of the complaint i made below  if you agree that she has acted improperly  please respond saying so  two people of this opinion  one other  are required before a request for comment on her actions can be made this is a complaint relating to the conduct of administrator gwen gale with specific reference to her summary deletion of the section labelled criticism in the alex jones talk show host page on march her most substantive comments relating to the summary deletion were as follows single source cited says it s not clear what even happened i ve removed it following wp blp and wp weight  given the single cited source says it s not even clear what happened  it s nothing but a non notable  second hand anecdote about what may or may not have been a parking lot brawl  gwen gale  talk the grounds  as you put it  are wp blp  gwen gale  talk the complaint is based on five points gwen gale failed to follow proper policy with regard to deleting biographical material on living persons  viz  discussing it beforehand  the section had existed for some time  had been discussed and commented on extensively  and had been edited by several persons  as far as i am aware  gwen gale had no prior involvement in the page or the section concerned  certainly  i had never seen her name in any of the page history  unless it constituted a grave breach of some other policy  which not even gwen gale has claimed  any possible deletion should have been discussed beforehand and not executed summarily  to quote the blp policy biographical material about a living individual that is not compliant with this policy should be improved and rectified  if this is not possible  then it should be removed  no complaint about the nature of the material was made beforehand  no opportunity for improvement or rectification was offered having failed to discuss it properly beforehand  gwen gale also failed to discuss it properly afterwards  she made a few general remarks  using terms which  as will be discussed later  do not form part of any wikipedia policy  viz  single sourced  anecdotal and breezily referred those who wanted to discuss the matter with her to general wikipedia policy documents  such as biography of living persons or verifiability  as will be shown in what follows the text did not violate either of these policy documents  gwen gale refused multiple specific requests to quote the exact passages of the biography on living persons or verifiability policies which she claimed had been violated  this refusal to properly discuss a summary deletion is against wikipedia conduct guidelines and not acceptable behaviour in an administator gwen gale s comments on the summary deletion reveal that she does not understand the core wikipedia policy on reliable sources gwen gale s comments indicate that she does not understand the proper scope of wikipedia s policy on verifiability gwen gale s comments reveal that she does not understand wikipedia s biography on living persons policy the only serious grounds on which deletion of the deleted text could be justified is weight  this is not the ground on which gwen gale chose to defend it  she repeatedly cited blp and v as the core defence of her actions  demonstrating that her judgement is massively flawed and that her administrative powers should be revoked  the core issue here is not the content  the core issue is gwen gale s conduct and judgement  the weight issue will  however  be discussed at the end gwen gale s misunderstanding of the wikipedia s guidelines on reliable sourcing it is clear that gwen gale does not understand wikipedia s policy on sourcing  in stating that the claims embodied in the deleted text were anecdotal she is effectively second guessing the judgement of the original reliable source  viz  the austin chronicle  she is implicitly expressing the view that the austin chronicle s assembled journalists  editors  sub editors and lawyers made an error in judgement in publishing the article in the first place  this is completely unacceptable and represents a fundamental error in judgement  it is in no way appropriate for wikipedia editors to make their own subjective judgements about the editorial standards of highly reputable and professional publications  it is the equivalent of an editor disputing a reference to a professional academic journal on,0

 i believe that the clean air act trial is deserving of a separate section  given the potential enormous exposure that bp has and the fact that this trial will be ongoing  generating headlines  through next year  some editors have stated in edit summaries that this paragraph is soapboxing  but i don t think that it is  the trial  which has received extensive cover in the media  deals with issues for which bp has already pleaded guilty  and faces fine of up to billion  the presence of other articles is immaterial  this is a very serious trial  and it behooves us to mention it to readers  and state what is at stake  failure to do so would be a serious npov violation  as is the fact that the legal jeopardy that bp faces is not mentioned in the article thanks to the recent edits  an i have so tagged the article on the figure  the bp corporate editor monitoring the article on the talk page here has indicated that other sourcing states that the actual figure of bp s exposure from this trial is really billion  not billion  if that can be verified  the figure can be adjusted  but first we need to deal with whether we are going to deal with this in the article at all  right now we are in the extraordinary position of an article on bp not stating that the u s  justice department is seeking maximal penalties in the billions concerning an issue in which bp has already pleaded guilty to criminal charges  ,0

 thanks  for the nawlinwiki  talk my pleasure  i think i have to apologize for subjecting you to the diatribe it engendered but  as i think you might agree  it tends to prove the point in an ironic way  i just looked at your talk page and decided that the minor whining  i  get from new page patrol is relatively polite compared to what you seem to have attracted  hence the accounting taste talk nalinwiki  you deleted my article while i was still writing it on the basis that it contained no references whatsoever but allow your own article to stand even though it contains no references whatsoever please  please explain how your point been proven in an ironic way go ahead  explain it  all i have seen so far from you is reckless deletion of other people s work followed by pathetic back slapping from like minded wreckers  if you are going to have a dig at me  why not do it on my own talk page  you weren t shy to destroy four hours of my work  so why be shy now  kont dracula  talk i think you ve confused the two of us  i must take credit for some statements that have apparently offended you  having signed them  so feel free to express yourself here about them  if you want the contents of an article that was deleted  in order to work on adding citations in a sandbox page  you can either ask me or another administrator for assistance  if you have any other questions about wikipedia policies  i ll be happy to direct you to the relevant pages  and if you d like to work on contributing to wikipedia in a worthwhile way  in accordance with our policies  i think everyone here will try to assist you  accounting taste talk no  i haven t confused anything  there is not very much to confuse between you two drones anyway  i see that you are not very good at answering specific questions about specific articles  evidently  you feel much safer describing deleted articles that you have not even read as steaming crap than you are actually discussing the actual merits of said articles  a really positive  worthwhile contribution there  is that the kind of contribution you want me to make  hardly surprising that you prefer the classic politburo repsonse of directing me to the relevant regulations rather than discuss the merits of the case in question  yet you have the arch hypocrisy to highlight the assume good faith legend on your page well i do have some questions about wikipedia policy  as you mention it is it an acceptable practice for a wikipedia adminstrator to delete articles which are in the very process of being written without consultation or clarification on the basis that they do not contain references when the very same administrator has himself posted less relevant articles which do not contain references himself if the answer to the above is yes  and i have to conclude that it is  as that is precisely what has happened  would it be fair to conclude that wikipedia administrators feel themselves above and not subject to the same criteria for notability and verification as non administrators  after all  my article contained no references and was deleted  nawlinwiki s contained no references and was amended when i pointed it out  please refer me to the relevant pages  kont dracula  talk yes  to the first part of the question  administrators can delete articles without consultation or clarification  articles that are being considered for deletion are assessed entirely on their own terms  and not with reference to any other article  so comparison of your article  which i have read  with any article created or edited by anyone else is not a relevant consideration  you can read the relevant policy at wp wax well i didn t expect you to be so candid about it  so you believe that it is entirely acceptable for an administrator to completely ignore the very regulations that he is so dogmatically enforcing onto others  you still haven t referred me to the relevant page on that one but no  you have not read my article because it was in the very process of being written when it was deleted  i am sure that there was a great deal of improvement that it required  there were some slightly whimiscial and humourous details which were possibly not appropriate for a wikipedia entry  it wasn t perfect  you see  that is why i was editing it and indeed still writing it of course  in reality we know that you have not actually expressed your own opinion  you were pretty forward with your opinion the other day though  weren t you  you described other people s articles as steaming  shit now though  you are not quite so forward with your opinion  instead  you try to retreat behind guidelines r,0

first of all have you compared the merkavas dimensions with the other tanks what you wrote here was rubbish  all the main battle tanks in the world are not air mobile capable  no helo designed or in service anywhere in the world can carry them  nor can they be parachuted too heavy  all these mbt s including the merkava  can fit aboard the c galaxy and c globemaster air  trans ports to be airlifted anywhere on the globe  the merkava mk has a hp gd diesel engine and additional armor  especially up top  for urban battlefields  ever been to the holy land  you get all types of terrain there  not the stereotypical desert arabian landscape that is always seen on tv  there are forests and swamps in israel  and up north the terrain is especially rough and it snows too  what consensus are you talking about  israel has had more battlefield experience with the use of armor and armored warfare in general than any country on this planet  the weight of the merkava mk is approximately the same as the m a sep  it has more crew protection than the leopard tank and has an active self defense system  it also retains the mm mortar which can be fired under armor  battlefiled mobility of the merkava series of tanks is better than both the m  and the leopard  it is true that both tanks are faster than the merkava but the merkava was designed with emphasis on crew protection  survivability and firepower  over speed  the merkava is more survivable in a firepower saturated environment meaning it can go places the m  and leopard cannot  for this reason the merkava has more freedom to maneuver  which gives more options to it s operators and commanders  and allows more aggressive courses of action  the enemy cannot simply deny areas to the merkavas by firepower  meaning the israeli tank has better battlefield mobility than the abrams and leo ,0

 legends pertaining to mucalinda i have heard and read from several sources a story which elaborates on the mucalinda legend according to this story  the buddha was pleased with his protector and blessed him by placing a hand on his hood as a sign of the buddha s blessing  cobras bear his fingerprints on their hoods indian or spectacled cobras  naja naja  of course have two ocelli or eyespot markings on the back of their hood  these are thought to serve as eyes in the back of the head  with the adaptive function of deterring predators that might try to attack the standing cobra from behind this story may be told in thailand also  although there is a slight inconsistency in that thai cobras  naja kaouthia  have only one spot  i have also heard a variant in which the buddha was protected by the serpent not from rain storms but from the blazing indian sun unfortunately  i cannot find a decent source for either of these elements in the mucalinda story and do not know where they originated ,0

kristof the problem here is a lag from the old ukrainian orthography that has since changed  a similar case existed in belarus  but much more amplified  when the changes of s and subsequent orthographic reforms were very noticeable it affected the way whole cities were spelled  example minsk and mensk  in fact that is the reason why there are two versions of belarusian edition wikipedia  one uses the old and the other the official adopted version  in ukrainian language a similar happened but to lesser extent  and only some cities were affected e g  rivne became rovno  luhanske became luhansk  konotip became konotop and so on  with our city as far as i am aware it too became during the s some of those changes were reversed  and it really falls to because in ukrainian there are sufficient differences between dialects  in fact if you compare western and central ukrainian the differences would be more vivid than that of british and american english  so for some cases like rivne  it was much up to the locals  because volhynian dialect pronounces the city like its spelled  whilst somewhere in poltava they will say it as rovno  it seems that with mukhachevo it is a case that the version used by locals is not entirely adopted nationwide  but then again there are some silly people in the government who use spellings such as sevatopil but that is outright stupid  because even in classic orthography that version would never be used  the  pil originates from the connotation of field like ternopil  the  pol comes from the greek root for city  like sevastopol  all the more reasons why we should stick to mukachevo and help to leave the archaic spelling where it belongs in history ,0

a lot depends on how the various companies have set themselves up financially  companies that have committed themselves to buy feedstock or wafers at high prices for the next several years are going to have bigger problems than those who have some flexibility in their contracts  for example  it will also depend on how their lines are set up on how reliant they are on manual labor  on cell production lines at large manufacturers i think you will find little reliance on manual labor in either country but regardless  a tariff would push pv prices up just as they re finally beginning to come down  i don t that s a good idea  i also don t think it would have the desired effect  i don t have any figures on how much pv the us imports from china  but some of us pv exports go to china  furthermore  the us is still a net exporter of pv modules so for a tariff to have the desired effect i think it would have to be levied by some other government that is more significant to the chinese pv industry ,0

 posted from maryland talk page with acknowledgement from thisisbossi  i m getting the sense of a double standard for maryland here  why is maryland the focus of this brigade when other state intros are equivalent  i ve avoided posting in these discussions because it seems you guys are reluctant to seeing the truth and now i have to write a book to get my point across  even still you will believe what you want to because of personal preference or you don t feel it belongs most of all i m sure you could care less about the state itself otherwise you wouldn t object  but you want an answer so here it is if you think the intro to the maryland page needs a rework then you have your work cut out for you because you re going to have to change just about every other state  case in point  this is the last paragraph from the commonwealth of virginia intro  virginia is known as the mother of presidents because it is the birthplace of eight u s  presidents  george washington  thomas jefferson  james madison  james monroe  william henry harrison  john tyler  zachary taylor  and woodrow wilson more than any other state  most of the united states  early presidents were from the state  virginia has also been known as the mother of states because portions of the original colony subsequently became kentucky  indiana  illinois  and west virginia as well as some portions of ohio  how is that anymore relevant than proclaiming maryland donated the land for washington  d c  doesn t talk about presidents from decades past and ceding portions of land belong in the history section according to you not convinced  here s part of the intro from the state of wisconsin  this should put your economic fears to rest wisconsin s rural economy was originally based farming  especially dairy mining  and lumbering  in the th century tourism became important  and many people living on former farms commuted to jobs elsewhere  large scale industrialization began in the late th century in the southeast of the state  with the city of milwaukee as its major center  in recent decades  service industries  especially medicine and education  have become dominant  wisconsin s landscape  largely shaped by the wisconsin glaciation of the last ice age  makes the state popular for both tourism and many forms of outdoor recreation in previous version they were proclaiming fur trade  but it s a sin to proclaim the life sciences which has become the foremost important industry in maryland right now didn t get the message  try the commonwealth of massachusetts during the th century  massachusetts  trans formed itself from a mainly agricultural economy to a manufacturing one  making use of its many rivers for power to operate factories for shoes  furniture  and clothing  its economy declined in the early twentieth century when industry moved south in search of cheaper labor  a revitalization came in the s when  nourished by the graduates of the area s many elite institutions of higher education  the boston suburbs  particularly those around route became home to dozens of high technology companies  massachusetts  colleges and universities  as well as its technology sectors  continue to thrive the state is also considered a haven for progressive  liberal thought and often sends political candidates to the national scene  however  the four most recent presidential aspirants  ted kennedy  michael dukakis  paul tsongas  and john kerry  were all unsuccessful massachusetts was the home state of us presidents john adams  john quincy adams  calvin coolidge  and john f  kennedy  and the birth state of george h  w  bush  as of massachusetts is the only state in the union to legalize marriage of  gay  and lesbian couples must i continue  it should be clear by now  said  my version was hardly all about geography  it had a sentence touching upon its civil war history as well as some information on its population and economy this is what you left posted in the intro maryland  ipa m l  nd nicknamed the old line state and the free state  is located along the east coast of the us  historically a border state  it exhibits characteristics of both the northern and southern regions of the united states  consequently  it can be considered both a mid atlantic state and a south atlantic state  maryland comprises a mountainous western panhandle  a fertile coastal plain  and a central region  chesapeake bay is largely within the confines of the state  the broad central region includes a stretch of the eastern megalopolis  an entirely metropolitan r,0

suggestion hello i noticed your edits to emf related articles  which were brought up on the adminstrators  noticeboard  i don t disagree with the core of your assertions  nor with the need to present prevailing scientific opinion as such and minority views as minority views  however  your approach is raising some hackles  i d suggest discussing your concerns further on the article talk pages and trying to reach some sort of consensus about how to better present the mainstream view of emf related health issues  tirades  however justified they may feel  are counterproductive in the long run  although it often doesn t feel like it  reasonableness will eventually win out here if you re able to cool off and explain your position calmly  making rapid fire edits to the pages in question while a controversy is unsettled on the talk page is not a good idea  if you re deeply concerned about the current version  you can tag it with pov or totallydisputed until the issue is resolved on the talk page this is not ideal  but preferable to an edit war  talk,0

 too technical comment the maintenance template too technical has been removed  i consider large swathes of the article are too technical and incomprehensible  for instance  what on earth do these statements mean tensed sentences  which can neither be  trans lated into synonymous tenseless sentences nor be given tenseless  token reflexive truth conditions  correspond  if true  to tensed facts  the experience of temporal becoming  like our experience of the external world  is properly regarded as veridical  in the absence of objective distinctions between past  present  and future  the relations ordering events on the tenseless theory are only gratuitously regarded as genuinely temporal relations of earlier later than  the claim that temporal becoming is mind dependent is self defeating  since the subjective illusion of becoming involves itself an objective becoming in the contents of consciousness  time as it plays a role in physics is a pale abstraction of a richer metaphysical reality  omitting indexical elements such as the here and the now in the interest of universalizing the formulations of natural laws  can anyone make the article more readable and comprehensible  or are we all pretending that it makes perfect sense  because we re afraid to look unintelligent for not understanding it ,0

vellalars as agriculturists i dispute the argument that vellalars are basically agriculturists even historian mr  vincent a smith in his book  the oxford student s history of india  says  vellalars are one of the caste in tamil nadu which do not have any association with any one particular job like every caste of tamil nadu including mudhaliar  udayar  vanniar  nadar  gownder  vellalars too involved in farming you can also refer the gazette of salem district publish by tamil nadu government vellalars migrated to kerala along with pandiyan kings  as pandians needed scholars with them when they had war with cheras if no one replies to this dispute  i will re write the contents about vellalars s occupation,0

so how does any of this justify wholesale deletion of the criticism section  in fact if what you re saying is true  then you should have no problem with my edits to the criticism section  your argument is that it s feasible to cover the relevant controversies in a neutral and balanced manner  written as part of the history section  and avoiding unnecessary direct quotation of political opponents  smear phrases which means that not only are can changes to the quotes of criticism of counterpunch be done  but that would also mean you need to have the quotes of criticisms to exist in the first place in order to make the changes so that the quotes are written in a balanced manner ,0
 bias in the introduction the introduction s last line since he became the leader of the bnp several educational institutions have invited him to speak on political radicalism  multiculturalism  and bnp policy  is unweighted and does not at all represent the controversy  outcries  and actual uncommonness of the particular  invites also  where is the mention of griffin s unquestionable notoriety  are we trying to inform people about him in an encyclopedic sense  ie give a broad and unbiased picture of him that would actually be useful to someone or make a safe unoffensive bnp friendly article please don t leave this to other people  i have already made a few unsucessful edits today it only takes one committed person to revert you on wikipedia  to make change impossible for any single editor to achieve  there is a  rr revert rule  and admins are always ready to block users and lock articles when perceived  edit wars  happen  wikipedia needs people to jump in and have a go  ,0

oh  now sources have to come from more than one country i hadn t noticed that requirement before is that true of all wikipedia articles for example  if there are sources all from the united states  new york times  washington post  san francicso chronicle  etc  etc  for a particular point in a given article  wikipedia editors would insist on a source outside the united states if so  that s good to know  sam  one person s obsession is another person s interest i wouldn t waste your precious time worrying about what other people do or don t find interesting ,0
as it stands  you say this posed picture indicates to you that manning wasn t that frail  and looks smiling and happy  if it is placed here to put the lie to the text and sources about aspects of her past  then it is arguably not neutral  however cute  i wouldn t support having a picture of kissinger smiling and joking next to text that described him as being in serious wartime negotiations  i m not saying the picture is objectionable in and of itself  i m saying  pending a chance for arguments for its inclusion  it makes the article less unarguably neutral  if the picture causes you to say that the text overstates her height issues  health issues  level of childhood happiness etc  then it is arguably not an appropriate image based on the text and sources describing her past ,0

  dear omedon  although you did the first revert  and then did another one  you accused me of edit warring  that s a personal attack  why  exactly  aren t you guilty of the same  i m giving you the victory  but letting you know i believe you should not be an editor because you aren t qualified  its time for wikipedia to go pro  fire all the amateur editors  and hire a professional staff  i e writers and editors who won t try to whitewash historical villains like jefferson davis by referring to him as an american and deleting any attempt to identify him for what he really was  which was the leading proponent  and a hefty practitioner  of slavery  ardenhathaway ,0

why i would like to see some explanation of the multi faceted rationales for this rather statist mandate  rather unprecedented in the technology history of the usa because it allows for absolutely no choice on the part of consumers users the introduction cited political  economic issues  there are also military issues perhaps  and the capability of the technology involved all hint at a series of reasons that are not clear in everything i ve read on the topic am i the only one confused on this issue ,0
 coloring could someone color the obstacle diagrams like in the sasuke article talk  work ,0
sorry about that tried to revert at same time,0
nunn the gun  a tag has been placed on nunn the gun  requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia  this has been done because the article seems to be about a person  group of people  band  club  company  or web content  but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable  see the guidelines for notability here if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable  you may contest the tagging  to do this  please add  on the top of the page and leave a note on the article s talk page explaining your position  please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself please read the criteria for speedy deletion  specifically  articles and our general biography criteria  feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this  talk contribs ,0
 block block i was told by the contact wikipedia page that one was to either e mail the administrator who  block  them or contact them on their talk page while i do not have an irc channel  i figured contacting here would be the best way  i am the user currently in charge of the ip address which you  block i m not sure why it was  block as i ve only used wikipedia to read entries  the only entry i ever edited was one on air force one  and that was to change a mistake of the location of andrews air force base  as for that edit  it is because i live near the base myself and know the area well  if this is the reason for my banning  then i would say you re two years behind schedule i haven t hurt anyone  and i m not around the internet nearly enough to edit any pages  so giving myself my own login wouldn t be necessary i would appreciate if someone resolved the matter of my blocking  please regards  k i ,0

hi idiot why are you delate my talking  just come out say,1
peer review while a peer review would help  i doubt that the article would pass a gan  it simply isn t there yet  the unsourced information would definitely be pointed out  i think a more appropriate move would to get it listed into the proper projects and then have it assessed  then  after that  i think a gan would be a wonderful move speak page,0
i understood the articles to be newspaper reports and as i didn t see them on the page i simply added a very neutral informative sentence  as far as i can see you are not disputing the sentence so why on earth are you hassling me here  you appear to be assuming bad faith where none exists and your comments as such appear to be a direct attack on me  please leave it there ,0

 what do the three edits feb have to do with the sock puppetry investigation of coi from and early this all seems like a big stretch to formulate a grand conspiracy theory where there isn t any  editors were aware of the coi back when it happened  years ago  and dealt with it the article is edited and watched closely now  are the only recent edits those three attempted additions to the barack obama article  hardly a high crime it seems to me what you re really upset about is that someone did an unfavorable  but accurate  story about how all attempts to include any mention of controversies or criticisms in the obama article were reverted  news flash  many of us have had the exact same experience this editor had  if we block users for editing under false pretenses so be it  but lots of editors post on other sites about their experiences here  this hardly seems like some grand scheme to bring wikipedia to its knees  this check user investigation  however  and the afd certainly look like an overeaction that only adds fuel to the fire  klein said he asked someone to make the edits to see what would happen  he reported on the experience and those he witnessed of other attempts to edit the page that are easily viewed through the history this hardly seems like something worth making a federal case over  the only mischaracterization is yours under false pretenses to incite a block and  through off wiki agitation  bring disrepute on the project and trigger a major meltdown on the obama page  the fact is the editor in question arranged for an attempt to make a reasonable edit to grotesquely biased article and reported on the experience that it s not favorable to wikipedia is certainly cause for reflection and consideration of how we can improve our handling of issues like this in the future i know when something messed up is noted on another site and people here are made aware of it there s usually an effort to fix it that happened in this case  but the guardians of the obama page made sure nothing changed so be it  if it upsets and embarasses you as it does me  do something to fix it  ,0
i agree with sh  that sort of  improvement  should be illegal ,0
response so  i m sure you re a really nice guy  but it looks like you re adding the tags not because of the the article needing a cleanup and reorganizing but just because the color scheme of the column boxes are not the color scheme of original boxes and are matching the roc nation colors and of the logo that is just plain out bias it not my fault that other people do not do this when creating a record label studio album discography  which they can and you have not seen one with a color scheme on them  all i have done is put the basic colors black  red and white of roc nation on a original wikipedia column to distinguish it from other record label albums discography and the other names of the artists that are on the article  because the article would grow as those and more artist release more studio albums and mixtapes  which makes it appropriate and not inappropriate as you have stated for you reason of adding cleanup reorganize tags  once again all i did is add basic colors to the original columns black  red and white which anybody can do on any other record label discographies on wikipedia  but i may have been the first to do this new color scheme styling of a record label studio album discography that does not mean you just add tags that are not meant to be on a specific article that is formatted  organized and written like any other record label albums discographies on wikipedia and is fully verified there is no wikipedia rule that says this is not justified for a record label studio album discography except for you i m sure you re a really nice guy  but this just plain bias  which wikipedia does not condone from established editors or administrators ,0

 dj sammy can i please suggest you read wikipedia five pillars before proceeding further you need to understand that wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a fan site  blog or a we love sammy exercise  you are in real danger of having all your edits reverted if you do not comply with some of wikipedia s basic philosophies perhaps the easiest to understand is that this is not the place to put your personal viewpoints  see wikipedia neutral point of view and that edits are expected to include a cited source  see wikipedia verifiability thank you  ,0

 july utc i quote from wp npov  none of the views should be given undue weight or asserted as being judged as the truth in order that the various significant published viewpoints are made accessible to the reader  not just the most popular one  it should also not be asserted that the most popular view  or some sort of intermediate view among the different views  is the correct one to the extent that other views are mentioned only pejoratively  readers should be allowed to form their own opinions  well it is fairly obvious that there is a different viewpoint than from the official story and quickly it is growing to not be a minority  if you looked there is not so many hundreds of conspiracy theories anymore there has been research done and then there s plain facts that help bring this pov to light  it is simply amazing that in world history  no steel structure building has succumbed to fire  yet we have buildings destruct in virtually freefall in their own footprint due to fire it does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that something is wrong there  why are you admins collectively avoiding such reality ,0

it was in response to a question that i asked in replying to a post by afd hero although i did not ask the question specifically of slowart i would have thought that just providing an asked for diff was pretty much what arbcom had in mind when they allowed the banned editors to respond if you are now interpreting things more strictly that is fine with me  you might like to look at the link yourself and see if you can work out exactly who suggested  tree shaping  and on what basis ,0

sorry in re reading my edit summary i can see why you are confused i worded it poorly what i meant to say was that i agreed with the ip user s deletion  because that paragraph is unsourced  appeared to be a personal account thus violating coi policy  and in any case represented an anecdote of no general interest so  my edit summary was meant to be a comment on the passage that had been deleted  not your restoration of it should i do something to clarify i would not agree with restoring that deletion without some justification ,0

service award hello  i noticed you list yourself as a senior editor i  which requires both years of service and edits  x  s counter  however  reports that you only have a little over edits  in the grand scheme of things  this isn t a big deal  but since awards are one of the few means of positive reinforcement we have here on wikipedia  i feel it important we uphold their integrity  perhaps you were not aware that meeting both the tenure and edit count requirements are required to obtain these awards  or maybe you are counting edits from another account  w hate ver the case  these awards are self regulated  so i just wanted to bring the issue to your attention  thanks for your continued service to the  pedia  talk,0
  you are continuing to misrepresent my original objection my objection was not that  he didn t respond in hours or anything like that  you portrayed that as my objection  though instead  i objected that dodo wasn t addressing my actual objections other than his  driveby deletions and a template or two  he didn t respond to my complaints not only  did he not address my objections within a day  as you implied my original complaint was he didn t even eventually address my objections irresponsibly  and probably maliciously  you tried to make me look like  the bad guy  for objecting to dodo s repeated rapid deletions without waiting for consensus  etc  dodo was trying to act on the theory if somebody does anything even arguably criticizable  i can slap him down repeatedly by deleting his edits  without waiting for any sort of consensus  etc  evidently  that is your position as well  i say  no dodo never  in detail  responded to my repeated and detailed complaints of his behavior is the reason that  he is busy well  if he s so busy why did he have enough time to repeatedly delete my posts doesn t make sense  does it the answer is quite simple dodo  and  i suspect  many other self appointed  info  nazi  s  always have time to slap down other users  that s easy  and takes little time but they don t have enough time to actually defend their own actions when challenged dodo  and many others  amount to semi professional busybodies who strut their stuff by interfering with others  use of wp stop it  ,0

 st  the comic cover you used isn t the subject of the article  if anything it would bests used in the dc comics presents article  which makes it a poor example for a primary image nd  i have made several attempts to discuss it  and you have yet to give me a decent reason to keep the old image i uploaded  and you clearly are not going to listen and are only reverting the image and even demanding a discussion  becuase you are still clearly mad over the whole psylocke thing in which my image was kept and you are just trying to make sure you get your way this time  virtually every comic book article on this site uses a single image of the article s subject with nothing behind them  because a subjects image should be about them  in the old image superman is twice the size of kristin and you know this  and if anybody else were to have made that edit you would not be doing this edit warring  and wikipedia clearly states images  some copyrighted images may be used on wikipedia  providing they meet both the legal criteria for fair use  and wikipedia s own guidelines for non free content  copyrighted images that reasonably can be replaced by free libre images are not suitable for wikipedia cover art  cover art from various items  for identification only in the context of critical commentary of that item  not for identification without critical commentary unacceptable use a magazine cover  to illustrate the article on the person whose photograph is on the cover  however  if the cover itself is the subject of sourced discussion in the article  and if the cover does not have its own article  it may be appropriate  dc comics presents has it own article  and is not the subject of the article  so it is unacceptable to use here,0

you mean it is funny because no reliable source can confirm it  it is a lie  and ironically the guy is trying to use that lie in order to justify the use of christian theologians  preists and pastors to unbiasly affirm historicity  darwin had a normal arts degree not a degree in theology  and theologians are not historians with few exceptions  bart ehrman being one  an example if a real historian would be richard carrier who has a phd in ancient history  i agree with the other editors who question the use of pastors and priests as historians ,0

thanks for your message  i have already spent far too much time on the issue  so that i shall not take any further action  j milburn s argument is faulty  one cannot remove an image on the possibility of the events that may or may not take place in the future  the relevant question is whether my copyright statement is incorrect at the time being  and the answer to this is clearly in the negative  at least milburn has not come up with a free image of michael foot  thereby showing that my copyright statement were invalid  so that the image must stay  i have argued  but to no avail  that when a free image turns up  there is no a priori reason why a free image should at all become available at any foreseeable time from now that event renders my present copyright statement invalid  at which instance the present image must be replaced by the available free image  at present no law is violated  so that there is no reason why the image should be removed  but i have said this many times  and unless  ,0

 your message  first off  i stand corrected on the copyright for the mcaullife article i am new to wiki and didn t see that the refs that were coming from framingham com had been copied from nasa on your second note  regarding legal threats  you were off base a bit i wasn t threatening anything  i was implying that if this was a blatant copyright violation that someone else might be upset if that wasn t clear i apologize i was just on the lookout for bad articles  ,0

cia reliable source  the cia factbook is not a reliable source  apart from the fact that the article now uses the cia factbook for the vast majority of sources  most of the figures published in the factbook could easily have been plucked out of thin air  they have no source  for example a figure of of norwegians being christian is clearly ridiculous and is widely inaccurate  in that case the eurobarometer figure is much more sensible in terms of real world number  let s not forget that that the cia is the usa central intelligence agency  it is a politically biased body  we we say figures from  for example  the russian intelligence agency  iranian intelligence agency chinese intelligence agency as being reliable  no  so why the american intelligence agency in fact pretty much every references in this article is now the us cia factbook or the us department of state  wikipedia is never going to be taken seriously with this kind of bias  this is simply unencyclopedic,0
 why i do not understand the this article is no good banner or the low importance tag  perhaps it was written by someone close to the company  but it does not grovel at the feet of haas automation  the statements are accurate  not overly adulatory  not full of marketing hyperbole in a word  realistic  what do you want a statement by their competitors that they are worthless buffoons as far as low importance well they may not be  the  largest machine tool builder in the world but they are certainly in the top few  they are definitely the largest machine tool builder in the united states  if that is not important  but articles about some garage band that played a cover of lemon tree very pretty at mitzi s fifth birthday party merit in depth coverage  well what can i say they make machines  they make their own controls  they have a decent reputation and a large market share and this article is unbiased  i don t see the problem i am not connected to haas  by the way  ,0

 from user talk jimbo wales i wonder if you might consider i wonder if you might consider simply removing your political religious etc userboxes and asking others to do the same this seems to me to be the best way to quickly and easily end the userbox wars userboxes of a political or  more broadly  polemical  nature are bad for the project they are attractive to the wrong kinds of people  and they give visitors the wrong idea of what it means to be a wikipedian i think rather than us having to go through a mass deletion  which is what is likely to happen if the userbox fad doesn t go away it will be better to simply change the culture  one person at a time will you help me from wikien l the current situation with these things being in the main template namespace  and promoted as if healthy and normal in the wikipedia namespace  is that they are damaging to our culture they are attracting the wrong sort of people  and giving newcomers the wrong idea of what it means to be a wikipedian that s why they need to go not to censor people s self expression  but to make it clear that as a whole the community considers these things to be divisive and inappropriate  jimmy wales  jwales at wikia com  mon feb utc class boilerplate style float center width background ee border solid darkblue  px margin  px from wikipedia userboxes beliefs it should be noted that use of such userboxes is strongly discouraged at wikipedia  and it is likely that very soon all these userboxes will be deleted or moved to userspace soon  their use and creation is not recommended at this time jimmy wales  mon feb utc ,0

i can see it both ways  on the one hand  we can find substantial rss for every substantial building  if we really check all possible newspaper sources  including trade papers  sooner or later  they ll all be in googlenews googlebooks  at the very least for every building erected or planned before if we re going to hold to the gng  we have several choices a use an increasingly stringent definition of what we consider rss for wlocal  such as requiring regional sources  but that wont have any effect in large cities  b make a special provision about local requiring more than rss  such as rss showing notability in particular ways  c abandon or supplement gng in favor of distinct criteria that would exclude such articles  such as hotel rating level d  use combination articles e accept the articles  but require substantial content f simply accept the articles g use a wikipediatwo or wikipedialocal project as a supplement to wikipedia  the gng was originally adopted as a restrictive measure  this is no longer the case  the increase in easily available reliable web information has killed it s usefulness this way  it is now a rule that will increasingly work the other way around  many deletionists try to  elevate it into what they consider a basic policy on principles that are not specifically exclusionary  but rely on confusion of wp n with wp v many deletionists and others think that in principle it is the only logically  defensible way of having a guideline i wonder whether they will stick with it when it yields the opposite result to what they really want  or yield a result that contradicts their own intuition what i really want in g  above  a supplement that will maintain wp v and wp npov and other foundation principles  but not have a wp n barrier  the inclusionists will be able to get in essentially everything  the deletionists will be able to remove a good bit of borderline content from the present wikipedia and  btw  i do not consider wikia an equivalent  for even if we had one that did not  fail wp v and wp npo  i remain committed to a free encyclopedia  free in  particular from advertising either in the articles or surrounding them  but we have to deal with the present structure and the present question w hate ver may have been said elsewhere which i am deliberately not looking atwhat  himalayan says above makes sense to me  it is a combination of my choices c and e aboverely on ratings level  and work for better content  covent garden hotel is at present a very low quality articlethe afd seems based on the possibility of there being a better article  the present one does  in my opinion  violate not travel and not promotional  i would have had to support keeping it however  because that is fixable  i would have said weak keep  as peterkingiron did for the same reason  talk  ,0

well  tiamut  you replaced the existing source with this  it is reasonable that it be tested as for arafat  i imagined you were trying to write a comprehensive and neutral article  with all facts of interest to the reader and bunking with arafat is at least as interesting as the chain smoking bit regarding the book the organization he belongs to published it with a publisher that is  at the least  affiliated with it selfpub applies to organizations as well as individuals it is the sole source for this quote note the part in wp selfpub where it talks about if a fact is truly significant  it would be included in another  more reliable source corrie is only peripherally the subject of the book  and many of the statements in there are opinionated and unsourced in fact  we don t even know what the source  footnote is  it doesn t seem to be included in the google books version do you have a hard copy the quotation is at variance with the language quoted in the hrw report while hrw is not a rs either  it is a bit odd that there is this variance do we even know what language the autopsy was in they might be saying the same thing after all  rocks falling on you is mechanical pressure  we need to find a better source ,0

 anons concerns cont d  on the grav locked  red dwarf planet note that a planet gravitationally locked to its star will have tidal heating like io  so it s not as if everything will freeze on the night side  the great advantage of a grav locked planet is its stability  i think it s fair to say that stability is easier for life to deal with than instability  if you look at the stability of jupiter s great red spot years and posited to be permanent weather on a grav locked planet should be relatively stable  i presume a convection rising at the sun pole and falling at the dark pole with terrain eddies  of course  such a planet will have no axial tilt  no day night cyclei don t even think it can have an eccentric orbit  but i m unsure  this greatly reduces the complexity of an organism s job  for example a plant doesn t need the night mode earth plants need  they would not have to drop leaves for winter  these seem like advantages to me based on the best information i can find on the us dept  of energy site  solar information what plants get on a clear equinox day is about kwh m peaking at kw m the vast majority of that power comes in the middle hours  less than kwh m is in morning and evening  the night is essentially kwh m  not absolutely  no  but to the digit accuracy i was using  yes compare visual magnitudes of sun vs  moon this varies by latitude and season  of course  now let s plug this into the supposedly horrible variation of a red dwarf  instead of roughly time at kw  yes  it really is close to that equivalent energy would be all the time at kw  thus  the variation would be kw during minimums of kw  and  of course is kw  thus  ignoring frequency  the red dwarf plant has an easier time  the lower power of red dwarfs just pull the hz in  considering earth shade plants  which live on far less than kw m the hz is where the total solar and gravitational energy are right for water organizationally  perhaps the best thing would be to treat earth like planets in the main flow of the article  then discuss tidally locked red dwarf planets  with a note that thinking on the issue is in flux  and note that chemosynthsis biospheres would be possible even around brown dwarfs or outlying moons  like titan and europa  perhaps  keeping original numbers suitable star systems spectral class binary systems  since all but the closest binaries are ok  put it here a stable habitable zone planetary characteristics mass acceptable energy variation  as i hope i showed about  low isn t really necessary  include the case of jovian moons in the hz high metallicity  it comes from system formation but it s a planet property geochemistry  maybe combine with metallicity alternative biologies red dwarf systems  tidally locked  low light new chemosynthesis based biology on  no changes i should add  this is a really good article  maybe i m trying to gild the lily  mistake i am not a specialist but mars  by contrast  is nearly  or perhaps totally  geologically dead and has lost much of its atmosphere mass paragraph  seems doubtful to me  i mean  mars still has volcanoes  mount olympus for example  so it sees strange to me that it s geologically dead  but once again i am no specialist  mars does have volcanoes  but as far as i know  they re not really active  so nothing is really powering them and geological activity isn t really showing up  luna  earth s moon has volcanoes  and it s accepted as geologically dead  the presence of volcanoes doesn t mean active volcanoes that s basically what i was trying to say  i guess i just never made it really clear  picture size  can a larger size by found for the habitability zone picture  i d like to use it as a background  but it won t scale up  i downloaded it here http library thinkquest org though i can t remember the exact spot on the site  an image search for habitable zone turns it up first thing  but only at k  earth s geological activity i am pretty sure that the earth isn t geologically active simply because of its large mass surface area ratio  from what i have read  i believe that planets are probably heated mostly by radioactive decay  and or tidal for,0

 to user martin hogbin  look  i would do it if it were true to my knowledge and or there existed some reliable sources to confirm that  the saveur com article  the only source against my claim that i consider at least semi reliable  says it can also be eaten before it is allowed to ferment do you think this confirms the existence of unfermented kimchi against all sources i gathered  someone might like to have a bite of sauerkraut before it is fermented i don t want to argue with you or something  but i have heard that beer is made from only malt  hops  and water in germany  as it should be unfortunately  at least in korea  japan  and the u s most beer includes rice  potato  corn starch  and many other ingredients i think unnecessary  at least they have ingredient lists on the bottles  and there are a lot of official documents on those additional ingredients  but kimchi is a different story  like i said  i have never seen any packaged jarred kimchi labeled unfermented maybe except for japanses kimuchi which is more like pickled vegetables  and both traditional and contemporary kimchi is fermented they are not much different anyway nevertheless  i am willing to temper my claim if editors can find even a couple of reliable sources that say some kimchi is unfermented  ,0

 possible original research  i only skimmed through on these parts  but it seems to me that most of this needs to be cited either for verification  or simply for the sake of further reading french people often refer to metropolitan france as l hexagone  the hexagon because of the geometric shape of its territory unless it was a frenchman or frenchwoman who added that in  how can we know for certain that they really do  is this self made nickname for that region so internationally renowned that it s a surefire fact  unless one can respond in the affirmative to either question  it needs a citation there are various theories as to the origin of the name of the franks  one is that it is derived from the proto germanic word frankon which  trans lates as javelin or lance as the throwing axe of the franks was known as a francisca another proposed etymology is that in an ancient germanic language  frank means free as opposed to slave  this word still exists in french as franc  it is also used as the  trans lation of frank and to name the local money  until the use of the euro in the s however  rather than the ethnic name of the franks coming from the word frank  it is also probable that the word is derived from the ethnic name of the franks  the connection being that only the franks  as the conquering class  had the status of freemen  in german  france is still called frankreich  which literally means realm of the franks in order to distinguish from the frankish empire of charlemagne  modern france is called frankreich  while the frankish realm is called frankenreich now here we re talking about cite cite cite for crying out loud cite  some of this might not only be original research  but speculation  also  two wikipedia no nos riddled into one  it seems like you only walk one paragraph or two down the article and bam  the poor thing is literally kissed with original research  something has to be done  the original research label goes back till it s done  ,0

 fourth examination th december additional statements  the sum of a thousand pounds  or crowns  was given by the king of england for the surrender of the maid  and an annuity of pounds to the soldier of the duke of burgundy who had captured her  i was appointed notary in the trial  together with a certain guillaume boisguillaume  the copy of the process was shown to me is the true copy made  i acknowledge my own and my companion s signatures  and that it is the truth  two other copies were made  one was given to the inquisitor  one to the king of england  and one to the bishop of beauvais  this process was made from a certain minute written in french  by my own hand  which was given up to the judges  and was afterwards  trans lated from the french into latin by monsieur thomas de courcelles and myself  in the form in which it now stands  as well and as faithfully as possible  long after the death and execution of jeanne  as for the act of accusation and other parts of the process  maitre thomas de courcelles had very little to do with these  nor did he greatly interfere with them  with regard to the word nota  written above certain articles in the minute  there was  on the first day of the inquiry  a great tumult in the chapel of the castle at rouen  where  that day  the interrogation was held  so that jeanne was interrupted at almost every word  while she was speaking of her apparitions  certain secretaries were there two or three of the king of england  who registered  as they chose  her words and depositions  omitting all her defense and all which tended to exonerate her  i complained of this  saying it was irregular  and that i would not be responsible  as clerk  in this matter  and  therefore  on the morrow  the place of meeting was changed and convened in a certain hall of the castle  near the great hall  while two english were placed to keep order  when there were difficulties as to jeanne s answers  and some said she had not replied as i had written  i wrote nota at the top  in order that the questions might be repeated and the difficulties removed  although it is mentioned in the process that the judges stated they had received preliminary evidence  i do not remember to have seen or heard of it  but i know that  if it had been produced  it would have been inserted in the process  jeanne was brought to rouen and not to paris  because  as i think  the king of england and the principal people of his council were there  at the beginning of the process  i was sent for to attend a meeting held at a certain house near the castle  at which were present the bishop of beauvais  the abbe  of fecamp  maitre nicolas loyseleur  and many others  the bishop told me it was necessary that i should serve the king  that they meant to bring a fine case against this said jeanne  and that i was to recommend another greffier to assist me  i therefore nominated boisguillaume  i met lohier in the church  on the day after the bishop had asked him to give an opinion on the process  and inquired what he you ght of it  he replied  that the process was of no value  and could not be maintained  because it was conducted in the castle and not in a legal court  that it concerned many who were not summoned  that jeanne had no counsel  and for many other reasons  he added that  in his opinion  it was their intention to put her to death  a certain maitre nicolas de houppeville was summoned to attend the trial  and was in great danger  because he refused  maitre jean lemaitre  sub inquisitor  delayed as long as possible his attendance at the trial  and was much vexed at being compelled to attend  one day  when jeanne was being questioned  jean de chatillon spoke in her favor  saying that she was not compelled to reply to the question put to her  or to that effect  this much displeased the bishop of beauvais and his following  and there was a great tumult at his words  the bishop ordered him to be quiet  and to let the judges speak  on another occasion  when some one was advising and directing jeanne on the question of submission to the church  the bishop said  hold your tongue  in the devil s name  i do not remember the name of him who was thus spoken to  one day  some one  whose name i do not remember  having spoken of jeanne in a way which did not please the earl of stafford  the latter followed him  sword in hand  to some place of sanctuary  and  if they had not told stafford that that place was sacred  he would have slain him  those who seemed to me most affected  against jeanne  were beaupere  midi  and de touraine  one day  i went with the bishop of beauvais and the earl of warwick to the prison where jeanne was  and we found her in irons  it was said that at night she was fastened with iron chains  but i did not see her so fas,0

 i blieve the  trans lation from the press office is very good  for someone who is not german this may not be clear  but the first paragraph states intentions  not facts  in germany there are still people who physically hurt other people and  very few  state authorities who do not act against this  so i believe using is may be confusing  if you want to do a literal  trans lation  the upper version is closer to the original  while the press office version is closer to the meaning  diverse errors and unencelopedic context use i would like to ask this whole article to be checked through  while most of it seems all right  there are passages that make no sense  lack imporatant information or are plain wrong  examples  first paragraph of drafting process is the outbreak of the racial fanaticism in germany cost humanity approximately million people  or of the world population  about of all casualties were civilians  who died as a result of disease  starvation  genocide  in particular  the holocaust massacres  and aerial bombing  while the numbers may or may not be correct  what is the purpose of this paragraph  the people who died and especially the people who did not die because of the war but because of the holocaust are very important for the way to grundgesetz was written  but there is no connection made  the next paragraph does not make reference to this and mentions the necessity to keep history from repeating itself in a much more neutral way  later on  any war could and should be categorised as an atrocity but the war that  nazi  germany started brought a scale of atrocity never previously known and the statistics of world war ii clearly qualify it  by far  as the most heinous atrocity in all recorded history  unverified claim  clearly anti german  the figures i heard suggest that both stalin and mao had a higher death toll than  nazi  germany  correct  most of their dead were in their own country  but i do not see how that would make it any better and created thereby in germany the legal situation within which any association of persons that  by reason of their aims or the behaviour of their members or adherents  seek to undermine or abolish this constitutional order is simply illegal  and which assigns to all germans the absolute right and duty to resist any person seeking to undermine or abolish this constitutional order  because this demand makes on the entire german people the memory of the million casualties which brought the outbreak of the racial fanaticism in  hitler  s germany  while it is unclear where this text comes from  it does not seem to be a quote  i do not believe that this demand makes on the entire german people the memory of million casualties is something that should be claimed in wikipedia if it is not a direct or indirect quote of some political  moral or other authority  there is also context missing the the right and duty to resist  violence by the people is only intended as a last resort and is illegal if there is functional police or military loyal to the consitution to deal with the situation  directly below the list with senseless emphasis  there is the claim that the german consitution contains blasphemy  huh  the preamble contains a direct reference to god  other than that there is a rule that religion and state must not interfere in each others buisiness  i am not seeing any blasphemy there  at that time  germany was a fairly religious state  to sum it up  i believe there was some editor here that wanted to make modern germany look bad by applying non neutral wording and some unverified claims  the german version of this article seems much better and  logically  is checked much more often than this one  i suggest either having someone who not only read the whole grundgesetz  but also has significant political and historical knowlege check this article for further inaccuracies or using the german version  which i believe is often checked by people who know the subject  to check this one through  there should be sources to every claim and despite the atrocities in the third reich  wording should be neutral and the crimes of the  nazi s should only be mentioned in a context where it makes sense  ps  sorry for the vandalism on this discussion page  there seems to have been an error while previewing this comment  ,0

 do you even understand how ironic this statement is hello  i m ronz  wikipedia is written by people who have a wide diversity of opinions  but we try hard to make sure articles have a neutral point of view  your recent edit seemed less than neutral to me  so i removed it for now  if you think i made a mistake  or if you have any questions  you can leave me a message on my talk page  thank you  ronz  talk see also wp or and wp battle  ronz  talk if this is a shared ip address  and you did not make the edit  consider creating an account for yourself so you can avoid further irrelevant notices what you just did  is called censorship  censorship  you do not like my opinion  so you censored it  i made no edits  i simply expressed opinions  i did not change anything  i brought up logical statements for discussion  who are you anyway  who gave you the power to decide what is neutral i do not understand what your purpose is  haha  who are you  the official  the authority  the almighty  i have to discus with you how my statements are necessary and then you  the official  decide  how ironic  are you aware you go against everything wikipedia is about  unregulated discussion  ,0
 leave in greenfield  ma org event incident since there are a whole list of  future  positive things listed  such as kids making pretty things  people on bikes with fancy armbands  and people planting trees  i thought it would not be out of line to list a negative event that  actually  occurred at a org demonstration it s hard on the one hand to say that this event wasn t related to org but then include all these other events that are just as related there are plenty of mentions of negative signs in the articles on tea party and demonstrations did the organizers of those events intend for those signs to be there no are they worth mentioning yes it s pretty notable that one of these events featured a threat to a person bounties on private citizens don t go up every day this article is a lot like an ad  but i guess that s the intent of the most persistent wikipedia editors  if it puts them in a positive light  it s totally relevant and notable if negative  it s not notable and totally tangential  ,0

 caucasoid  is it really necessary to mention that some uyghurs are fair skinned and have caucasoid traits  it sounds a bit like  nazi  science to me  luis rib  well  they do have such traits  you can phrase it a bit differently if you like oct utc it wouldn t be necessary if we lived in a world in which race  whether considered a real or constructed category  was irrelevant  unfortunately  that s not the case  the ethnic characteristics of uyghurs play an important role in discussions of the relationship between uyghurs and han chinese and thus how chinese xinjiang is or should be  in order to understand the politics of uyghur chinese relations  it s important to know that these characteristics are commonly discussed february utc why caucasoid traits  these traits are probably more semitic than caucasoid the more we try to parse this issue the thornier it gets  read the caucasian race entry in wikipedia and see if you can find any way to separate semitic from caucasoid  the entire concept of race is in dispute  and regardless of how people ordinarily discuss differences  an encyclopedia ought to try to avoid such uninformed hypotheses in its entries  it might be better to describe  for example  a people as having blue eyes and fair skin and lacking the epicanthic fold  as well as being largely muslim  than to try to categorize them by race  and so i d agree that dropping caucasoid would be smart  after all  much of the european population has at least some mongolian ancestry  as do iranians  turks  central asians  and so on and uyghurs are certainly included in this distribution regardless of their caucasoid traits  and if you go back far enough  i suppose the entire world population has african ancestry  you can see how this can become like an argument about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin  and has no place in an encyclopedia that is trying to be authoritative and factual  ,0

 there is a problem here  is that some editors claim detroit is not the birthplace of techno  but do not provide citations to back up their position  at the same time  the internet is bulging at the seams with information showing that detroit is where techno was birthed  certainly  europe has adopted techno as it s own  more than america or even detroit ever has or did  but unless we can get some real citations going we need to remove  what i see as  the wishful editing claims that techno began in western europe  we require citations  i m honestly pretty neutral in this  i enjoy techno  but i prefer other genres  i just happened to stumble across the article  read the first sentence and checked the citation for the western europe claim  as it was news to me  and was sent to a dead page  i searched techno origins and found numerous pages saying detroit birthed techno and added those cites  the evidence is just flat out contradictory to what some editors  wish to  believe  honestly i do not care  but if wikipedia is to be a reliable source  we as a community must be honest with what the facts are  or provide evidence  in citations  for alternate claims  i won t be doing any further edits in this article  i ll leave this one alone  i can sense this could turn ugly real quick  so i leave it to people who care more than i do  ultimately  if i m wrong fine  no biggie  just please give good citations  ,0

 retired numbers peyton manning removal a user  who i ve engaged in conversation on their talk page  removed peyton manning from the retired numbers section of the article  on the grounds that it s assumed though not official  my reasoning as posted on said talk page  was that jim irsay  the ceo of the colts  stated pretty firmly that no player will ever wear the number again  http w thephinsider com peyton manning press conference  trans cript free agency nfl there need not be an official retirement ceremony  or banner hanging in the rafters for the number to be retired as such  i would open it up to discussion  but i feel that manning needs to be readded  with the sourcing material included to prevent future confusion ,0

 i have posted nothing on the article page as this would presumably be a conflict of interest  and have made here suggestions of the way in which the book may be used only because requested my view remains that it should be done by an editor who does not have coi  i think that now we ve moved on from the efforts to exclude a source through  wrong  application of the notability guidelines we re left with neutrality of point of view as the main issue  wikipedia reports what is out there and a decision to exclude entirely from an article an appropriate source which has a view on much that is in the article  as well as topics the article excludes  appears to be a bias  the idea that the only book of lit crit on beedle the bard has nothing whatsoever to add to an encyclopaedia article on the topic is incredible  i don t think coin is central to the issue as it now stands  rather the central issue is npv  i think there are wider issues which it would be interesting to discuss for example had my username not been essentially my real name a post on the talk page a year ago saying hi guys  this book exists and has something to say about the article would not have generated this negative discussion  i suggest medcab is a way forward because it can consider all issues  while coin considers only one issue and probably one which is not central  ,0

the article titled the elliott argument is very well sourced  noteable  has tons of references  and seems to meet all the criteria it in no way is attacking any group but rather is a formal argument that is neutral and has a strong footing in the creationism vs atheism debating scene it will undoubtably will be swamped by atheists trying to take it down and site reasons why it should not be on wikipedia  i ask that you please keep it up in all fairness as a lot of work has went into the creation of this article and the formal argument itself  reminder  if it wasn t worthy and no one cared about it  it wouldnt be such a talked about topic article of conversation thank you  and i hope i have met all your standards  also  atheists please do not edit or attempt to censor thsi article  but rather if you can feel you can defeat the argument leave it up as proof that it is flawed thank you again,0

  about your improvements  good work  in general  i am still feeling lost about the description of henry cow s music being  intense a change from  intensities any music can be  intense  for an aficionado  me  i think frith is intense  d something more descriptive is needed  regarding the presence of beppe colli  i do not see his notability  and the web magazine clouds and clocks is not mentioned elsewhere  by other media sources  when i google clouds and clocks i get a lecture on rationality by sir karl raimund popper  and i get a children s book on encopresis  the soiling of pants  similarly  beppe colli does not get mentioned elsewhere  the man and the website are not notable  applying the same criteria to babyblaue seiten and the german reviewer achim breiling  i find that breiling is a medical researcher who has published papers about genes  proteins and cloning  and has written prog rock reviews for the new gibraltar encyclopedia of music in addition to a bunch of them at babyblaue  cdbaby lists babyblaue seiten as a source  and an article exists about that review site in the german wikipedia  it looks like breiling in babyblaue is somewhat more reliable a source than colli in clouds  although colli s observations are interesting  i cannot see keeping them  it s too bad  because he is the only reviewer who hinted at the cd having some loudness war characteristics  a step down from the dynamic spaciousness of the lp  about the bursts with quote from van peer  the word  eradicates  was wrong  van peer wrote  eradiates which is not a word  but he may have intended this construction as a neologism  that  or he misspelled  radiates in any event  i returned  eradiates  to the article  and added a  sic  template  ,0

 the primary goal of the case based textbook is to inform doctors of what to do when they are asked to perform different medical operations  the case based textbook only has one chapter on circumcision  its primary goal is to inform doctors of how to react in the case they are asked to perform a circumcision  it does not give an overview of questions that have been raised about the procedure  and doesn t cover sources of controversy in the medical field  only debates this makes it unfit to speak for this topic  maybe it would be better to use it to highlight another statement involving controversies in the medical field the second source titled controversies with one author is ok  as it does go over some medical controversies that exist  notably in consent and the parental role i think a better sourcing for this statement ethical and legal questions regarding informed consent and autonomy have been raised over non therapeutic neonatal circumcision would be one that highlights significant questions from community groups in a specific demographic  if we could get a source that is clearly indicating that these questions are being raised that would be better johnp  ,0

apple likes to pretend that the idea for dashboard came from deskaccessories  but there is almost no similarity between the two the implementation of dashboard uses much more similar technologies to konfabulator and they look almost identical i mean  if desk accessories were written in a markup language of some sort  had polished and shiny graphics  ran all the time  whether they were being shown or not and looked just like konfab or karamba  then they might have a point  but none of those things are true ,0

 feedback as requested hey antonin  i m only too happy to help out  as much as i can having so many problems elsewhere  in fact  completely and utterly stuck and rather despondent about it all  first impressions  not yet a balanced article a lot on the controversies  too little on the magazine and its background  the latter  i think  needs clarification  what was the czech political cultural context  and how did this produce the magazine conservative is too vague i think readers will benefit from being told more about czech conservatism  then there s the magazine itself  who started it  and what were they doing before this editorial policy  contributors trans fer of ownership  if any  and whether or not the magazine has changed since its acquisition by the media group  put it this way  certainly in the uk  and probably in the us an award for growing the best cannabis plant isn t something usually associated with a conservative magazine  i ll put this page on my watch list  i ll be happy to sort out any copy issues  btw  best regards  thanks for your opinions  davey  you are right  the article is not balanced  i m trying to use only sources independent on the magazine itself  and unfortunately the sources deal mainly with controversies  there is an overview of the history of reflex in the th anniversary issue  i ll try to expand the article with that information and answer your questions  btw  reflex is sometimes really considered as a conservative magazine  could there be a little difference between the perception of the term in the professional and well developed anglo american journalism and the perception of still young independent czech journalism  using of this term in the post communist world is quite complicated  as conservatism defends traditional values and continuity  and the first free post communist media  including reflex  had to start building again  to some extent they had to find the values and the interrupted tradition  the provocative cannabis award could be an attempt to test the borders of freedom of speech and to come closer to independent and bold journalism  this is  however  just my vague point of view  we should probably avoid this association on english wikipedia  as this is a world grown in a completely different tradition and experience  again  thanks for pointing out the problems  i ll work on it  i ve attempted to expand and clarify the origins and background of the magazine as recommended  yes  i ve been hovering over your shoulder the whole time  good beefy stuff  d you reckon you re pretty much done with the content cos i do  and intend twiddling up the prose some time this weekend  by the way  it s no big deal but are you ok with all those red links hi davey  you won t believe how happy i am seeing that you are still interested  i m careful with the red links  this project has still gaps in detailed covering of czech topics  all of the red linked names are notable czech journalists  see the czech wiki articles for jan ib  k  petr h  jek  ji x  dole  al  tom fe  tek  josef kl  ma  ji pehe  tom bald  nsk bohumil pe  inka  milo erm  k  pavl  na wolfov with the red colour i m trying to point out that they should have articles also here  thank you for your help and interest  ask w hate ver oh  i know how that one feels  it can be a strange and lonely business indeed  still  here come the queries constitution and editorial continuity  d you know who owned it in the first place  was it a one man show which employed petr h  jek  or was he owner and editor  sorry to be picky here  but it ll matter  particularly as this is living persons biog yes  the blp issue is the main reason why i asked for your help  h  jek was the owner  together with andrej astn and ji fleyberk  he seems to be the most important one  according to my sources  ok  so the sale of the magazine  over the heads of the editorial board  was entirely legal  despite the resentment  d you think this was seen as a matter of personal gain and freedom of action  on his part  vs personal responsibility,0

 news suppressed on wikipedia http rexcurry net wikipedialies html rexcurry net is the historian who made the following discoveries covered elsewhere and on wikipedia the usa s first pledge used a straight arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous national socialist german workers  party nazi s it was not an ancient roman salute http rexcurry net pledgesalute html the pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag  historic photographs are at http rexcurry net pledge  html and at http rexcurry net pledge military html due to the way that both gestures were used  the military salute led to the  nazi  salute  the  nazi  salute is an extended military salute  http rexcurry net book a contents pledge html the pledge s creator was a self proclaimed socialist in the nationalism movement in the usa and his dogma influenced socialists in germany  and his pledge was the origin of their salute nazi  means national socialist german workers  party  a mnemonic device is the swastika  hakenkreuz in german although the swastika was an ancient symbol  it was also used sometimes by german national socialists to represent s letters for their socialism hitler  altered his own signature to use the same stylized s letter for socialist  http rexcurry net book a contents swastika html  the pledge is part of the usa s growing police state the insane government in the u s  could cause comatose persons to pledge dis allegiance  desecrate the flag  and recite a declaration of independence  remove the pledge from the flag  remove flags from schools  remove schools from government as a libertarian lawyer  rex curry provides pro bono services nationwide in schools and elsewhere  to educate the public about the news government schools will never teach children about their pledge rights  nor the truth about the pledge and its author most comments fail to ever mention that francis bellamy and his cousin edward bellamy were national socialists in the usa  wrote for and supported their nationalist and new nation magazines  the nationalist educational association and pushed their totalitarian dogma in their nationalism clubs worldwide  including in germany  and that the bible of their movement  edward bellamy s book looking backward was  trans lated into every major language including the languages of those countries that became home to totalitarian socialism and the socialist wholecaust  of which the holocaust was a part  under the national socialist german workers  party million dead the union of soviet socialist republics million dead and the peoples  republic of china million dead it is easy to see why anyone would want to cover all of that up  but it should not be covered up in the usa  the bellamy dogma supported a government takeover of education the government s schools imposed segregation by law and taught racism as official policy the usa s behavior was an example for three decades before the  nazi s  as under  nazi sm  the jehovah s witnesses  and blacks and the jew ish and others in the usa attended government schools that dictated segregation  taught racism  and persecuted children who refused to perform the straight arm salute and robotically chant the pledge  some kids were expelled from government schools and had to use the many better alternatives there were acts of violence  when jesse owens competed in the olympics in germany  his neighbors attended segregated government schools where they saluted the flag with the  nazi  salute the u s  practice of official racism even outlasted the horrid party and the schools and the pledge still exist  the pledge is still the most visible sign of the usa s growing police state  after segregation in government s schools ended  the bellamy legacy caused more police state racism of forced busing that destroyed communities and neighborhoods and deepened hostilities bellamy was a self proclaimed national socialist in the usa  with the nationalist magazine  and he preached what he called military socialism  the federal flag darkens schools because bellamy wanted government to take over all schools and to eliminate all of the better alternatives worse  bellamy wanted the government to take over everything  not just schools  he wanted the government to impose the military system on all of society  school flags are a symbol of  nationalization  militarism  and socialism the bellamy dogma was the same dogma that led to the wholecaust of which the holocaust was a part million killed under the former union of soviet socialist republics million under the peoples  republic of china million under the national socialist german workers ,0

indeed  your e right  what s so frustrating about english is that if you are not a native speaker  or at least learend it at very young age  you will get hard time to get to closer level with native speaker of english  it may be much easier for people whose native tongue is german  dutch  some scandinavian languages  except for finnish  and etc but for me at the least it s not come naturaly  but i must say that during the last years i didn t have many opportunities to practice it extensively the english vocabulary is huge  not once there are different words for the very same object with most cases it s unnecessary  probably it s related to the expansions of the british empire i realy think that german and english are among the hardest languges to take control of  spanise on the other hand  is very friendly  ,0

 reply to mr  burdak i am glad to see you have at least referenced that quote now it was not at all clear before where it came from  as it does not agree with standard  trans lations of that passage  one wonders about the unusual wording so reminiscent of the odd quote you made from the mahabharata the other day  but  more importantly  what about the completely false reference to the history of civilizations of central asia  vol  ii why have you  again  not replied to my pointing out of this apparent dishonesty  this is only the most recent in a very long list of false quotes and references you have made and i have exposed on these pages as you well know  now  i am willing to accept that maybe one or two false quotes could be the result of honest mistakes or sloppy research but when the process is repeated over and over and over again one begins to suspect that the author is doing it deliberately and intends to deceive readers  so  quite naturally  i and others have come to mistrust any quotes you may give especially to sources that are difficult to check  i am sorry but you have brought this situation upon yourself  ,0

 evidence redux i ll be frank the blocking of  came a bit late for my taste however  he was found to be in violation of the revert rule  and to again quote the policy which ironically malke was threatening people with and was himself found to be in violation of a bright line exists on edit warring  known as the three revert rule rr if an administrator has not acted already by this point  then action is very likely  especially if a report is made to the noticeboard  policy forbids edit warring generally  and editors may be  block  if they edit war  with or without breaching  rr  i commend  for taking the actions he did the subsequent complaints malke made  and his promise to cease his activity in order to get un block  a few days later  are a matter of record on his user talk page malke has since deleted the notifications  but they are viewable in his talk page history  and make interesting reading after malke s block on august i decided i needed to take a step back for the past ten days i have busied myself with other wikipedia subjects i now return to this page i suggest we talk a bit about what happened  and i also suggest we take a look at what happened here this month  edit by edit it continues to seem clear to me that malke was editing with obsession towards an agenda  his obsession got him in hot water with the admins soon  wikipedia policy is going to change  as many here know i d welcome some reasonable discussion  and renewed work on the article  on closer examination of the history pages of the main article  it appears some of malke s biased edits  through sheer volume  are still in effect i propose going through every edit of his  see exactly what changes of his have survived  and put back all relevant  sourced material once that is effected  we can pick up the chore of dealing with further improvements  having just returned to wp from an extended absence  i am not fully familiar with what has occurred with this article  but cursory skimming of the talk page reminds me of some of the frustrations which led me to leave wp more than a year ago  i recognize malke s concerns  material that is added back should strictly follow wp blp  ie it should be directly relevant to rove  not defamatory  and should be sourced by reliable secondary sources  malke s concerns were one thing  his methods another admins  block  him not only due to his violation of the three edit rule  but because he was deleting paragraphs of properly sourced material  and as the admins noted  to quote directly from malke s talk page history  since he has since  for obvious reasons  deleted all reference to his blocking an impartial administrator just did  i don t know you from adam  and haven t so much as looked at the contents of your edits  all that matters is that you broke wp  rr  and received a short block for it  if you want to be un block all you have to do is agree to stop edit warring  regardless of whether you think it is justified or not  o i highly commend the admins  and urge others to support their work  these admins had not been involved here previously  they took firm  direct action on a disruptive editor  malke  who was judged to be making untrue statements regarding his efforts i again suggest we move past this period of turmoil and examine what changes were made to this article by an editor whose tactics earned him a block and who  in my view  obse,0
 january utc  wikipedia is hosted in the us  so us laws on copyright  etc  are enforcable  that s just the way it is  and we need to avoid legal action being taken against the foundation  to be honest  i don t see big differences in behaviour of editors by nationality  so far as nationality is apparent i suspect that there are just more americans here than any other nationality  simply due to sizes of populations of english speakers  so any group of editors is likely to have more americans than anything else  including the helpful  constructive  thoughtful ones  i think  however  that there are a higher proportion of editors here now than ever before who have little interest in adding and improving content  preferring to delete  argue  try to raise the bar on notability and fair use guidelines to allow more to be deleted  etc but i don t see this as a wholly us phenomenon ,0

i have just followed from your edit exchange on the article blu ray disc to find the exchange above sadly  you appear to know little about the subject  and to be fair  it has become confusing because much of the terminology has become abused first  european blu ray discs are not produced in p format  that is almost exclusively the preserve of the american regions secondly  the blu ray format does not support the proper progressive high definition formats p and p  and i include the p in that this is because the data rate is not fast enough for these formats the european sourced discs that state p on the packaging are discs produced from film originated material and is one of the abuses of the term progressive the term progressive strictly defines a video format where the lines of video information are recorded in strict numerical order alternatively  there is the interlaced format which displays the odd lines ony first  odd field  and then follows them by the even lines  even field you probably know this already they are actually stored in the digital video frame the other way around due to the digital video format s origins in the ntsc world in true video source material  the even field displays a time slice that is milliseconds later than the odd field and the two together give a comlete video frame this is also largely true in the americas  except the even field precedes the odd field by miliiseconds there is a largish group of enthusiasts  if that s the right word  who have become somewhat anally retentive over the progressive video formats and who have convinced themselves that progressive is the only way to go the reality is that any improvement in the visual perception of the video is marginal at best and certainly not worth the doubling of the required digital data to support it but for them  everything has to be progressive i shall coin the word  progressivists  for this discussion when film originated material is  trans ferred to video in europe  the film is run slightly fast by which allows one film frame to occupy both the the odd and even fields of the video frame  known as pulldown thus the even field displays a time slice that is milliseconds later than the odd field in order to satisfy the progressivists  the blu ray producers state that such material is in p format  but using something called a  progressive segmented frame  technique  though they don t mention that last bit on the box that is  that it is progressive video  but the odd lines have been recorded together and then they are followed by the even lines it is really interlaced video  but by the time the display device or the blu ray player has de interlaced the video  it doesn t matter one jot where it actually happens the result is perceptually indistinguishable from true p video  assuming the deinterlacing algorithm works properly if watched on a crt display then  of course  the video will be interlaced as there is no deinterlacing prior to display  but with that number of lines  no one is likely to notice  unless they sit inches away from the screen the description p on the box is  technically at least  wrong but percetually the same as p video the speed up goes completely un noticed especially these days when the sound is adjusted back to the original pitch and obviously you hadn t noticed it yourself if you had convinced yourself that you were watching films at the original speed once we cross to the americas  different problems occur obviously  running the film at frames per second is not an option  so instead  film is converted to video by storing the same film frame on half video frames  followed by storing the next frame on half video frames and then repeating thus film frames occupy video frames  the technique is pulldown often wrongly called pulldown properly deinterlaced  such material is perfectly watchable and the viewer unlikely to feel anything is wrong but the progressivists have decided that it is not the way to watch film material and have even invented faults to justify a move to a progressive format i have even seen claims  obviously failing to understand the technique  that movement in the resultant video is uneven in that it jumps further every other jump due to the half fields  the result was the p format the only problem with the p format is that if you try to watch it on a crt display  and a crt is still unbeatable for contrast and colour reproduction the result will be unviewable to bad flicker something that was known as long ag,0

 response i am obviously very disappointed by this decision  the assertion that i did not read the article is highly misleading  not to mention offensive  i have been a wikipedia editor for many  many years  and have followed the rules and regulations throughout these years  to suggest that i did not follow the regulations is complete bunkum  using the evidence present in the article  i made a choice based on what i thought was a fairly obvious case it still breaks our rules on blogs  recentism  notability  and bias  the keep votes are from people who have an immense level of conflict of interest  and therefore skew the vote something rotten  i am very disappointed that this entire episode has been carried out at my expense  rather than at the article itself  this response will be copied to as many concerned editors in this matter wordsdeeds  ,0
 from wp third opinion  the inclusion of that section gives undue weight to a particular pre hungary period in this article  hungary  such material would be better placed at hungarian prehistory or pannonian basin before the hungarians  with  links to great moravia where appropriate  the current article is almost kb long  and needs more concise summaries more than it needs additional sections  when deciding how much space and depth to devote to a particular aspect of a topic  it is important to take recourse to general sources and reflect their coverage  beyond the reliable sources threshold  the trustworthiness of a particular source is less important for determining weight in the treatment of a topic than is its generality  as an outsider  i could see adding up to a few dozen words based on the lingering impact of toponyms and script as a side note  please remember to stay focused on improving the article without recourse to personal attacks on other editors  as well  i remind you that whenever text is copied from one article to another  you must include this fact in your edit summary cont  ,0

hey drmies  are you ok  i can t imagine what i must have said on that ip s page to get you so upset that you ve decided to literally track my every edit  isn t there anything better that you can do with your time instead of this  you know  like move away from your computer and go out  talk to people and form friendships in real life  you ve said you have a family with a kid to take care of  but i now find that very hard to believe because i would assume you wouldn t have so much time for this nonsense if that were really the case i seriously hope i haven t hurt your feelings that much to prevent you from performing your daily duties off the world wide web  i would feel badly if that were the case  which now seems it actually is  call me vandal all you like  it doesn t matter to me  i wish you well ,0

 elton john has not sold less albums than queen in the uk  he s had lower sales per album  but the total sales of his albums is the uk is more than queen  also the uk rnr hall of fame would have nothing to gain  nothing to loose  by just taking any figure  doesn t mean they checked it by looking at world charts  list of back catalogue sales  etc  where in my text did i say i didn t like queen wheatear or not i like them  tolerate them or  hate  them has nothing to do with it  there is no source that says queen have world sales of million you can t take a bit from one and a bit from the other  you can only use one source  however my point stands  looking at global sales charts  and other sales lists  queen have not sold million albums  their best selling albums globally are greatest hits and greatest hits which combined sold million as of now  they havent sold another million besides  ,0

how they achieved the speed interesting mystery about sp  hundreds of pages written about it  how they made it lighter  shorter  more powerful  etc  but nowhere they say what they did to increase the speed  it flew just kph slower than the speed of sound  and it s a good thing  but neither boeing themselves  nor any other manufacturer ever tried to repeat this feat  why  with modern airliners being able to cover up to km why nobody makes them faster  what was done to the airfoil in that regard  does anyone know a source where this angle is covered ,0

apparently palit is found to be worthy of mention by nvidia  amazon  and pcuniverse  http w nvidia com object io html http w amazon com tag palit microsystems http w pcuniverse com palit microsystems bs h anyone familiar with newegg knows that it is a top internet retailer in terms of sales  putting it ahead of bestbuy com  etc i believe it is the electronics internet retailer  behind dell com if your products are on newegg  and on the front page of their video card section you deserve at least a small article on wikipedia unbelievably  evga is also marked for deletion  http en wikipedia org wiki talk evga  company even though evga is a very well known maker of video cards and motherboards in the past few years  i d assume they ve sold million in video cards annually  and yet people who know nothing about electronics mark it for deletion if wikipedia doesn t want sub million in sales corporations to be on it  then i guess palit may not make the cut  but it seems to me that the notoriety of these companies is mostly called into question by people who don t know a single computer corporation other than dell  apple  ibm  and gateway ,0

please view my video and pass it on to your friends and colleagues  the more viewers i get  will support my case in the court of public opinion and pressure the three involved companies  chrysler  compuware d b a professional services  and combustion components to settle my year homelessness search  corporate blacklisted engineer i worked as a mechanical design engineer for almost years collectively for the following companies  pratt and whitney  williams international  ford motor company  and as a contract engineer for compuware d b a professional services at chrysler corporation in auburn hills  mi  it is the latter two to which i am forging my complaint as they told prospective employers  my private investigator and my newspaper reporter  that i was not employed by them  thus blacklisting me  and preventing from all future employment  i believe that they did this to me because i found fault with one of chrysler s automotive designs that could have resulted in a safety issue  that they did not want to fix and it was easier and cheaper to get rid of me  i took my case all the way to the supreme court in washington  dc and in boston s federal court  all courts denied me justice  a lawyer representing chrysler offered me to settle the case about years ago which i refused since i felt it was like a slap in the face compared to the injustice they have caused me  your viewing of my video will greatly help to end my yrs of homelessness by increasing public awareness of my case and consequently  will send chrysler  compuware and combustion components a direct message that i am not giving up and refuse to go quietly into the night  thank you for your time and consideration  bill butler  read my story in progress at the following click on blog post ,0

  you ve got no call to start attacking me ad hominem  i know damned well how to use the history and talk pages  as for shoddy research  i  like many others  consider the school s own style guide to be the final word on the issue  the school s publications are entirely consistent with this  anyway  i m through with this  you obviously care about this way more than anyone else  i m sure others will come along and make this correction repeatedly until you back down  since the public style guide is probably what most people will consider the ultimate authority on this  don t bother messaging me back  i don t care that much  ,0

 sorry i find that there s nothing honorable about samurai ethics  it s largely blind loyalty and fanaticism  and lack any of the judeo christian values such as compassion and mercy  such are the values indoctrinated into imperial japanese soldiers when they slaughtered over chinese civillians in the nanjing massacre  tortured allied pows in prison camps such as changi  launched suicide kamikaze attacks against allied ships etc  not even the germans  who had at least at some judeo christian values left even under the  nazi  regime  match the level of fanaticism and pure evil of imperial japan ,0

 editing of article without consensus removal of cited content without discussion i find it telling that neither of you had the courtesy to respond to my proposal and k  went ahead to begin editing the article without any consensus being reached  let the record note that i am now compelled to reciprocate your actions and make my suggested changes  jj obviously lacks any serious knowledge in this area and was only here for circumventing  rr  so there s no point answering his most recent underinformed questions  i ll focus on kautilya if you were significantly acquainted with the topic  you would understand that the kakatiyas were feudatories of the eastern chalukya dynasty so the question of when the formal royal dynasty began is a natural question  not patent nonsense and probably one of the reasons some previous editor changed the old date to uncertain was the date given for the first royal inscription based on the permanent grant of hanumakonda  their original capital for your edification  as a fief to the kakatiyas  i also suggest you both refresh your knowledge of wp civility  to improve the quality of your current and future discussions  if you don t know about an author  here s a hint  ask politely  rather than first disrespectfully dismissing the author  then demanding his c v  what s more  his book speaks for itself  its the history and culture of andhra pradesh  the old state which included the new state of telangana this is not some arcane ivory tower speculative paper  but a wp rs  so if you want to change the date to ce  perfectly fine by me  the only difference is  i had the sense of responsibility to provide a citation  i suggest you do the same  let me repeat that i am perfectly fine with having a respectful dialogue  but as i ve said before  it takes two hands to clap  ball is in your court  gentlemen  ,0

 auto guides and the motoring press are not good sources for an encyclopedia article about luxury vehicle this is because automakers feed the press a lot of bs  boa shut the fuck upl superlatives  who then work hard to write articles adding even more bs to describe their products  the press earns credits from the hands that feed them  add to this the fact that potential and actual purchasers of luxury vehicles have an insatiable  appetite  for this type of bs  classifying a particular vehicle as luxury is also designed to easily make it superior to other vehicles even if the differences are superficial  using self serving bs in marketing claims is a very  very old invention that helps sell products  as well as fuel the fan base with bragging rights to which vehicles are luxury on the other hand  it is more difficult for most marketers to be humble and genuine  that is why an encyclopedia article has to avoid falling into the trap of using traditional marketing superlatives and hyperbole  ,0

the numbers in parentheses are the additional decimal points which have been measured but lie outside the accuracy of the measurement process  this means the values in the parentheses eg could be used for the purpose of calculation  but any value that results from such a calculation would not be more accurate than the number of significant figures if those in parentheses were not considered  in other words  the values in parentheses are there to help avoid rounding errors if you re trying to work to the limit of accuracy of the gas constant  i agree that this is not commonly known  and only confuses the issue  i would recommend removing it ,0
